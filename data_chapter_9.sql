INSERT INTO `chapter`(`book_id`,`name`,`data`,`number_of_read`,`upload_date`) VALUES(9,'chapter 1','Speaking straightforward, my life was already over.

If there was one thing to talk about in this life that had already ended, then that would be my father. My father was truly a trash like man.

There was a time where my father got drunk and harassed a girl. A female high school student at that. Even though I was dumbfounded, since it was my father, I knew that it was more than likely to happen.

“If you had to sexually harass someone, did you have to choose a female high schooler?”

“Girls these days sure are developing quite splendidly.”

That was the response I got when I went to meet him.

Let me correct myself.

My father wasn’t just trash, but food waste.

“That girl is younger than me by 5 years.”

“Only by 5 years? Are you perhaps still in college?”

My father narrowed his brows.
His expression was incredibly serious.

“I thought you were about 41 years old.”

“If you look at me properly you’d know that I have a childlike face.”

“Bahaha! Don’t make me laugh. You’ve had a mustache since you were just an infant.”

If only killing intent could actually kill.

My father’s expression shifted and gave me a worried glance.

“Is your mother really upset?”

“Which mother?”

I gave him a slight temper.

“There are at least 4 people I can call mother. I’m not really sure which one you’re referring to.”

“I’m talking about your mother.”

I let out a sigh.

I’ll say this now.

Harem is a crime.

It wasn’t enough to make a bunch of lovers, but to also have a child here and there as well, that was inexcusably the worst.

The person concerned may be fine.

But in the position of the child, I wanted to kill myself.

Even after the age of forty, the mothers continued the bloody competition and feud over my father. My father was constantly indecisive and never made a choice.

As a result, the ones to come to harm were the children. The only ones dying in the struggle between mothers were innocent little us.

‘If you were smarter then wouldn’t your father pay more attention to me! You have to get first place in your whole school no matter what!’

Do you understand how it feels to hear this kind of thing every single day. Circumstances for me were a bit better though since I was male. My little sisters were really pitiful. In order to gain even a little bit more affection, they had to flatter him each and every time they could.

In the position of myself who had to watch all this happen, my impression of my own father was the worst. The chances of something good about my father coming out of my own mouth would be asking for the impossible.

“Listen carefully. I’m going to tell you slowly and exactly what you should do from here on out. Nothing bad has come from listening to my advice before, right?”

“Naturally. I’m ready to listen carefully to whatever you have to say.”

“Then first, do your best to try to stay in prison for as long as possible and not come out.”

“Mm.”

My father furrowed his brows.

“That’s a bit different direction of advice I was hoping for.”

“Do not come out of prison and just stay there forever. Until you die. If the word ‘dismissal’ starts to float around or something, do not latch onto it. End your regret filled life in a cell.”

“I’ve never doubted that my son was dutiful up until now, but I’m starting to have my suspicions. Son. Is that really the best option?”

“My mother is trying to kill you.”

Silence.

My father tilted his head.

“Are you saying that she’s angry enough to might kill me?”

“No. I mean exactly what I said. She is trying to kill you.”

“Korean is quite hard—. It’s difficult to understand—.”

“According to the Standard Korean Language Dictionary made by the National Language Department, the verb ‘kill’ has eleven meanings. Amongst those I’m using the first meaning; my mother is really trying to kill you.”

“Can I ask what the definition for the first meaning is?”

“To cease or end another one’s life.”

“It was a life without any hopes or dreams……”

My father pressed his head into his hands.

He had finally grasped the seriousness of the situation.

“You’ve been calling my mother by some weird word like ‘tsundere’ for a long time now, but I’ll tell you this now. My mother is a ‘yandere’. Resent yourself for marrying someone you most shouldn’t have while also having multiple wives.”

“But when she looked at me with those bloodthirsty eyes my body would tingle…… That’s your mother’s charm!”

“Be great if you just died already.”

I muttered unintentionally.

I do not believe in God. There’s only one reason for that. If God really existed then the man in front of me would have been smited long time ago. My father was a Satanic person, an infectious germ that turned the people around him into atheists. I called it the ‘Human Trash Virus’.

“I didn’t know she was a high schooler in the first place. No, I groped that person’s butt not even knowing it was female. It’s unfair.”

“Then you lifted that skirt thinking it was a man? Congratulations. It’s fortunate that you were finally able to discover your actual sexual preference at that late of age. If you had realized 25 years sooner then the world could have been more peaceful, families could have been more tranquil, and my life could have been smoother.”

“I had 7 bottles of soju so I wasn’t sane.”

“Are you ever sane?”

I stood up from the seat.

I spoke while sullenly looking down at my father.

“Never bring up alcohol while in court. If they put that into consideration then your sentence will most likely be shortened. The day you leave prison, my mother will be waiting for you with a knife.”

“My beloved son……”

“Yes? Go ahead and speak, my not beloved father.”

“You must make good choices in life.”

I snorted.

“When you’re the one saying that, that sounds incredibly persuasive.”

“Right?”

“I’ll come visit whenever I have the time so make sure to behave.”

No matter who saw, my father was a failure of a husband.

There was no room for sympathy.

However, he was not a failure as a parent. Starting from me, my 6 siblings and I all were able to live wealthy lives. This was an incredible achievement. Also, while a person lives their life, be it as a husband or a parent, as long as they are successful in even one category I think they’re admirable. This way of thought still has not changed.

Stay in prison forever.

My father gladly listened to my last advice.

In the end, it became so.

Four days later, my father had passed away because of a heart attack.

♦

“I’m completely exhausted……”

After sorting out my boxes and furniture, I lied on my bed.

For the last month I had faced Hell. This was not a joke. If a demon could have seen my unsightly and miserable figure, then even they would have felt so much sympathy for me that they’d end up ascending as an angel.

I folded my fingers down one by one.

“The funeral is over. Set all the real estate in order. Passed over the foundation……”

I roughly threw away everything I needed to throw away from life.

Give up on the inheritance.

As soon as my father passed away I had dropped this bombshell.

My mother fainted and my half siblings made a commotion. My second half little sister was especially terrible. She clung onto me until my pants tore. However, my will was as firm as the snow piled at the very top of the Himalaya Mountains. If you want to break my stubbornness then you need to forward global warming by 600 years. Unfortunately, my mothers and siblings did not have the capability to immediately raise the carbon dioxide exhaust quantity around the world by seventy times the current amount at that time.

‘If brother retires, we’ll all be ruined!’

‘Big brother is a stupid idiot!’

‘I’m never contacting you again!’

Finally, once my second half little sister gave up, I escaped.

Phew.

A smile of satisfaction floated on my face.

To live the rest of one’s life is to live free from worldly cares. There’s no point in pretending to be something you’re not and buying things like a high noble. I’m too busy to go crazy and spend money on everything. While a few of my siblings were pleased that they had become the head of a company at such a young age, my second half little sister followed up with the statement— ‘Even if we end up ripping his(brother’s) ear off, we can’t let him go! Our household will be ruined within 6 years without him!’,—which I felt strongly for because I knew she was right.

“Okay. I’ve dealt with everything. I’m truly free now……!”

Thank you, father.

For passing away at an appropriate time.

This honest feeling may be an incredibly undutiful and immoral statement to say to one’s parent and it shakes my conscience by 1 mg, but if you consider the large amount of crap that my father had left behind on my life, the already little amount of conscience that remained seems to have vanished on its own.

I will never forget the moment he used his own son as a shield in order to avoid the knife being swung by my mother (a painful mid-summer memory from my second year of elementary school), even if I die.

All things considered, I’ve already won the game of life.

Currently, in my bank account, was the large sum of over five hundred million won(TL note: about 425,000$).

Just because I gave up on the inheritance doesn’t mean I didn’t fill my back pockets. I can enjoy the remainder of my life without having to ever work.

Yup.

Not the entirety of my life, but what remains.

I do not mean the definition to keep on living, but simply the meaning of what’s left. I purely desired for only this.

I got up from my bed and with a brush I wrote in large writing on a piece of parchment.

For the next 50 years, this will be the terms that’ll lead me for the remainder of my life.

┌                                              ┐  
   1. Do not work.
   2. Do not make friends.
   3. Do not get married.
└                                               ┘

“……Beautiful.”

I was moved by my own writing.

I wonder if when Pythagoras discovered the law of mathematics, he was as deeply touched as I am now.

First, do not work.
This was stupidly obvious.
I’ve heard that there are some people in the world who enjoyed fruits of labor in their life. Thankfully, I’m not one of those perverted masochist.

Second, do not make friends.
This was also obvious.
There are only backstabbers and potential backstabbers in the world. Friendship is merely a vain dream, a virtual image, a fantasy. I won’t take any counterarguments.

Third, do not get married.
–This was important.
My father had relations with five women. After having watched a live romance drama starring 6 people since I was a mere child, I’ve come to a grave and serious conclusion.
Marriage is an insane act.
Something like true love are all bull crap lies.
Love is merely a way of murder that has become surprisingly gentler. As a result, it’s possessive desire and sexual desire.

Of course, grown up members of society might have a different opinion than I. That’s okay. Be satisfied with your bright and beautiful marriage life. However, if maybe, just maybe, you end up separating from your partner……compared to your marriage life, so much more beautiful days will lie ahead of you. I’ll guarantee it. You have my word. For starters, the dangers of being stabbed by a knife disappears. This alone already seems like a huge benefit, don’t you think?

Yes.

I’m a pessimistic human.

I wasn’t like this from the very beginning. Believe me.

Originally, I was highly positive. The world was beautiful and the righteousness in my chest flopped around like a just caught mackerel. To be specific, I was like this until a month ago. However, after having witnessed my mothers do a 1:1:1:1 deathmatch in the middle of the funeral, I politely recycled my hopes and dreams into the trash.

That’s so. This world is tragic. Even if you’re vexed, what can you do. This is the truth. The carbon dioxide exhaust rate won’t go down, China will grasp capital over the entire world, Justin Bieber will receive the Nobel Prize in literature……, and in 122 years you’ll be dead, I’ll be dead, we’ll all be dead.

Oh, I’ll also tell you just in case; that adorable pet of yours will get hit by the front wheel of a bicycle and die…… I’m sorry to tell you the news, but what can you do? This is the truth.

If you’re done being sad then drink a beer.

To start off my carefree life, I went to the convenience store and bought 60 cans of beer.

The part-timer at the convenience store gave me a look as if asking ‘Excuse me, it’s not of my concern but is your life okay like this?’. I thanked the girl’s deep consideration and coolly swiped my card.

So what.

My card has damn five hundred million won. Five hundred million won is strong!

Take that! If you have a problem then come at me!

‘Son’

‘Whatever you choose’

‘Whatever you choose, you must choose better than me—’

I wonder if it was because of the beer.

I recalled something unpleasant.

A kind of trauma.

I opened a second can of beer and muttered.

“I succeeded in running away, father.”

Those were my last words to my father.

I stayed in the corner of my home and didn’t come out.

Goodbye, labor.

Goodbye, world.

I’ll be going to the world across the monitor.

Adieu.

♦

—Two months passed in a blink of an eye.

I’ve conquered the computer games I couldn’t enjoy for the past 4 years.

“This is life……”

I was silently moved to tears.

I’ve been only consuming convenience store packed lunches, so my current figure was getting close to the border of that of a homosapien gorilla.

Trash was littered on all four sides of me.

The desk with my monitor on top was especially impressive.

The Empire of Empty Cup Ramens and the Republic of Empty Beer Cans were conquering the desk—continent, and having their own world war while drawing all kinds of geometrical national borders. In this world I’m what you’d call an absolute God. If it’s unfavorable for the Empire then I’d add a cup ramen. If it’s unfavorable for the Republic then I’d add a beer can. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that it was thanks to me that balance was able to be kept in this continent……

At that moment a notification popped up on my monitor.

—Tirring~

An email arrived.

Moving my mouse over, I clicked to check it.

    [Thank you for enjoying our company’s game, <Dungeon Attack>. In order to improve for the next expansion, we are doing a survey. Participants will be able to gain the chance to be a beta tester for the next installment!]

It was a normal email.

My email address was probably subscribed when I bought the game.

Right when I was about to delete the mail, I hesitated.

“Next expansion, huh?”

A standard dungeon-capturing RPG, <Dungeon Attack>.

It was one of the games that I enjoyed during the two months.

Become a hero and defeat the Demon Lords.

The difficulty was a bit strange, so it was incredibly challenging. First run, I could barely defeat the mid-boss. Second run, third run, and finally on the sixteenth run, after tedious grinding, I was narrowly able to win against the final boss.

There’s no business in grinding.

My hero character got stronger after each run.

In the NPC’s perspective, I probably seemed like a fraud and a cheat, but what can you do? Life was irrational from the very start.

Some starts life with high stats while other’s don’t.

—click.

I accepted the survey with a click of my mouse. It’ll probably ask me questions like; was the difficulty reasonable, was there any inconvenience with the interface, boring questions like that. Regardless, I was able to spend an enjoyable amount of time on <Dungeon Attack>. I’ll play along.

A new page opened up on my monitor screen.

[1. In the end, I prefer small girls!]

[2. In the end, I prefer mature women!]

“……”

A completely unpredictable Mr. Question has appeared.

I grasped onto my mind that went blank for a moment.

What is this, a small joke? Are proper questions going to come out after this?

After thinking for a moment, I chose number 2. If you were someone with common sense then it was only appropriate to select number 2. Everyone, lolita complex is a mental illness.

On the white screen, the second question appeared.

[1. In the end, I get excited when I get hit by someone……!]

[2. In the end, I get excited when I hit someone……!]

“What kind of survey is this!?”

I shouted at the monitor.

The periods+exclamation mark at the end of the sentence made it feel pointlessly vivid. It looked as if you were confessing your secret sexual desires, doesn’t it……!

I glared at the monitor with a disgusted look.

For now, I selected number 2. To be hit or to hit. If I had to choose between the two, then I could only choose the latter. I’ve heard that there was a group of people in the world who felt pleasure from pain, but thank the heavens, I’m not a pervert.

[1. I prefer a low difficulty.]

[2. I prefer a high difficulty.]

After that, I got normal quality questions.

They most likely placed the weird questions in the front to gain the surveyee’s attention.

To compliment them for being smart, or to complain that they put too much thought into this survey.

[1. I solve my problems with strength.]

[2. I solve my problems with knowledge.]

Without any hesitation I chose number 2.

I stopped trying to solve my problems through force since the time I got beat up by the girl sitting next to me in kindergarten. People called humans like me a ‘refined pacifist’.

[1. I gain benefit from keeping other people’s secrets.]

[2. I gain pleasure from using other people’s secrets.]

Once again, with no hesitation, I chose number two.

During kindergarten, once I obtained the information that the girl sitting next to me wet her bed every morning, I took advantage of it as much as possible. After having done so, I learned the greatness of information. Diplomatic studies call this kind of politics ‘armed neutrality’.

[1. Friendship means to go forward together towards the same goal.]

[2. Friendship means a friend who hasn’t betrayed you yet.]

Ooh. I don’t know who it was, but they need to give a round of applause to the staff who made option number two.

Now that I think about it, I’ve been only choosing the second option. It must mean that number 1 points to abnormal and number 2 points to normal.

I think about thirty questions had passed.

A question with a different format was displayed for the first time.

[Do you know how this world ends?]

[Yes]

[No]

I stopped my mouse.

…… It was a question purposely made abstract.

It was a sentence that only players who very faithfully played the game could understand.

Dungeon Attack.

The hero subjugates the Demon Lords.

A simple structure.

However …… in the end, the world probably arrives at destruction. The reason why the word ‘probably’ was included was simple. The game did not kindly tell you what happened to the world after the ending. This was merely the conclusion I came to on my own while going through the campaign.

In <Dungeon Attack>, Demon Lords are owners of magical energy, people with a massive amount of magical energy condensed into them. What happens if all these people are killed off.

The magical energy will overflow.

Like as if many reservoirs collapse at the same time and cause a flood.

The hero killed off the Demon Lords in order to protect mankind and as a result the balance of magical energy collapsed, then, contrary to what was intended, the end of mankind and the destruction of the world……

This was what I thought to be the ‘true ending’ of the game.

Thank you very much, protagonist.

Thank you very much, player.

Yet, we must apologize, that due to your efforts the world was destroyed.

No hopes or dreams.

That’s why I liked it.

A pessimistic world outlook…… it suited my taste.

I spoke the words ‘yes’, and clicked my mouse.

As if it was calculating something, it took some time before the next question appeared.

The sentence to appear on screen was abstract again.

[If it were you, could you change the ending?]

I wonder.

To protect mankind and to also not slaughter demons.

In other words, to bring peace between the two races.

According to the setting, humans and demons have been going at each other for nearly 3,000 years. It’d probably be easier to make the leader of Islamic extremists reconcile with the president of the United States of America.

Would I be able to do such a thing……

I started thinking.

Then thought some more.

And…

[Yes]

The sound of a click rang, and at the same time.

“……!”

A bright white light shined from my monitor screen.

This was the last scenery I could remember.

A bell chimed somewhere. No, it could have been the sound of an explosion. The feeling of the world around me being flipped— as if my skull was being expanded on all four sides.

My hearing went numb and everything felt distant.

My vision kept blinking.

I couldn’t move my eyelids on my own accord.

As if someone else was opening and closing my eyes for me.

My conscience stopped.

Then.

Then…………

 

[The tutorial shall now begin.]

[Difficulty set to LUNATIC (Highest possible setting).]

[START]

Then I opened my eyes.

INSERT INTO `chapter`(`book_id`,`name`,`data`,`number_of_read`,`upload_date`) VALUES(9,'chapter 2','The ceiling broke and fell.

A large rock landed right in front of my face.

“What……!”

I quickly gained my senses.

Instinctively, I took a step back, however, with a thud, my back bumped against something. It was a wall.

Carefully looking around myself, I realized I was in a pitch black cavern.

I had gone to see a stalactite cave before during a school trip before. From what I could see, the ceiling now was 2-3 times higher than that cave. It was so high up that I could just barely see the top. I couldn’t possibly imagine how faraway the dark mouth of the cave was.

“……”

I killed my breath.

Why was I here?

How did I get here?

A loud siren rang in my head. My conscience instantly went cold. Whenever I found myself in an unpredicted situation my head would cool down in order to compose myself.

It was because of the trauma I had experienced when I was young.

I had been kidnapped three times in my life. The memory from those times forced open my skull and poured in ice-cold water, as if telling me to stay on my toes.

‘Do not scream’, that’ll only irritate the kidnappers.

‘Talk to yourself quietly’, you can confirm your situation this way.

Behavior procedures prepared like a manual.

Like a special forces unit listening to orders while facing terrorists, my conscience more than gladly followed the guidelines carved into my memory.

“……I was sitting in my room a moment ago…… and using the computer. It was 7PM. Drank 2 cans of beer. For dinner I had cup ramen……”

Little by little, my breathing became calmer.

There was no problem with my memory.

It at least meant that this wasn’t a drug induced kidnapping.

⌈There were no drugs.⌋

With just this the situation was reasonably favorable. It meant that the kidnapper had the intent to talk with me.

That’s why the kidnapping when I was in my third year of elementary school was serious. The motive then was to plainly obtain my body. I had to unconditionally keep my mouth shut. No reason whatsoever……

“Okay. Next……”

I checked my senses.

In order; vision, scent, hearing, taste, and touch.

Without rushing, I had to make sure my senses were working properly.

“The location appears to be a cave. Definitely a cave. It’s very dark. Doesn’t seem like my vision got worse. Rock, paper, scissor……”

I moved my fingers to make the shapes.

I could see the forms properly.

Good. My vision was fine.

The problem was scent.

“……!”

A foul nauseating smell.

The smell of blood vibrated around me.

I wonder if it was because I had suddenly found myself in an unfamiliar environment, but I wasn’t paying attention to the smell until now. Now that I’ve realized it, the revolting smell was so intense that it felt like it got past my nostril’s and shook my very brain.

“This is……”

It was a scent I had smelled three or four times in my life.

A scent which I never wanted to smell again. The smell of blood and intestines.

Corpses were spread throughout the cave.

There were human corpses that were swollen as if they were drowned, bodies with slit throats, and even bodies with limbs bent in the wrong direction.

“Eugh…… euuk……”

If this cave was one of those art exhibitions, then the curator would undoubtedly be an absurdly perverted sadist. As if triumphantly displaying that humans could die in this many ways. The fact that the cave was dark was the only solace since the corpses were comparatively hard to see.

“Is this place supposed to be the mystery of the human body…… Damn it.”

I had to get out of here quickly.

I put my right foot forward and— fell just like that.

My ankle was broken.

The entire bone was broken. It wasn’t something like an adorable sprain.

“Shit.”

I unintentionally let out a curse. I had to conclude that I couldn’t run or walk. The pain wasn’t ordinary. If the kidnapper approached now then it was impossible to escape. Perhaps they broke my ankle on purpose. Keeping safety measures. This was probably why they didn’t use drugs.

“Haa.”

I sat down in defeat.

I was regretfully checkmated.

Why did they kidnap someone like me, I couldn’t understand.

“…… I left all the fortune to my siblings. If it was two months ago then maybe, but there’s no point of kidnapping me right now.”

Surely they don’t mean to take me as hostage and threaten my siblings.

Foolish. I don’t know about someone else, but the person currently leading our household was my second half little sister. She could manage the household with composure, although not as good as I did. You’ll get hurt if you underestimate my sibling just because she’s young.

“Hooo……”

I could only sigh when thinking about who the culprit was.

There were plenty of people spread across the world who could want revenge against me. There were also surprisingly a lot of fellows who still had a grudge against my father as well, but wanted to let it out on me instead. That’s why I wanted to wipe my hands clean of everything.

It was then that I heard a hurried voice coming from the other side of the cave.

“I found him!”

“The Demon Lord is here!”

Demon Lord.

It was a name that had absolutely no connections with me.

For some reason the voice was directed towards where I was.

I’m confused. I had been called a devil a considerable amount of times in my life, but this was the first time I had been called a Demon Lord. It might be a type of secret code.

“Stay right there!”

“We’ll kill you if you move!”

The people came in like wolves.

The men were holding edged weapons like knives and axes. There’s no way I couldn’t be bewildered by this. I shot up both my arms.

“I surrender!”

“Get down you bastard!”

Without warning, the other man grabbed my head and slammed it to the ground. They were violent with me even though I told them that I surrendered.

“Ack……”

A rock that was lying on the ground sharply stabbed against my cheek.

“Keep your damn face down! Stay like that till we say otherwise!”

I almost let out a shout of pain, but I was able to hold it back.

Loud noises irritated kidnappers. During a kidnapping, even if you’re in pain you must not scream.

3rd year of Elementary school, I didn’t know anything and kept on wailing. After being beat until five of my teeth were broken, I had learned to be silent.

Silently.

Politely.

It may seem stupid, but this was the proper attitude to have towards a kidnapper.

“I caught him! Riff of Jalsen, has captured the Demon Lord!”

“Ooh. Our great and handsome captain, Riff. You aren’t planning to take all the bounty on your own, are you?”

The men started chatting in excitement.

I held my breath and listened to their conversation.

“Of course not. I’ll share with everyone equally. Keke.”

“Look at this. This Demon Lord looks just like a caterpillar.”

“Looks good with his head on the ground. Let’s kill him already.”

“What do you mean, kill him? There are things we still haven’t asked him yet.”

Someone kicked my side.

It wasn’t a genuine hit but more done jokingly, regardless that alone was pretty painful.

“—but just in case, we should break him.”

“Friends! Let us beat the Demon Lord into a reasonably sized pulp.”

Merciless violence showered down upon me.

Ten people were kicking me. I desperately held back my screams. More than 5 minutes had passed before the kicking started to subside.

“Good good. That’s enough.”

“Guys. Our handsome boss said to stop.”

“Keke.”

The violence finally stopped.

While I was breathing roughly, one of the men spoke to me as a representative.

“Well now, honorable Demon Lord. There’s one thing that we wish to ask you. Where’s all the money in this castle. To tell you the truth, us village folk are in real need of money.”

As expected, I was kidnapped for money.

Wait, but they’ve been keep using words that I’m not familiar with. This was something that I had to confirm. There was a chance that they were mistaking me for someone else.

“What do you mean by ‘Demon Lord’……?”

When I opened my mouth, I let out a groan. My lips were torn.

“Good. Very good.”

The man insinuated.

“Despite being hit so much, you’re still able to display such a nature. An excellent stance. Keke. I don’t hate that kind of thing, your honorable Demon Lord.”

With a rough hand the man grabbed my hair.

“Ack……”

I was forced to raise my face.

I made eye contact with the man in front of me.

The man had bent his body forward and was looking down at me. His entire face was covered in a brown beard. A darkish mushroom that grew in a public bathroom that hadn’t been cleaned for over 5 years, that was what his beard looked like. In simpler words, frighteningly dirty.

“But my friends here don’t have as much patience as me.”

“……what can I help you with?”

“Your honor. We don’t desire to use pointless violence.”

That’s convincing.

“Instead of wasting each other’s energy, let us trade. Tell us where the treasury is and we will not kill your honor immediately. We won’t cut your arms or legs off. And, of course, we won’t cut your precious horn off, either. Think carefully. In truth, we’re the ones at a loss in this trade.”

“Yeah, at a great loss!”

They broke out into laughter.

It was laughter of people who had a rough birth.

I waited for the mood to settle before speaking again. Always courteously. Making sure to not irritate their mood.

I asked a question.

“I’m sorry, but what do you mean by horn?”

“Aah? What are you asking.”

The man placed his hand on the back of my head.

“This. I’m talking about this.”

The man had grabbed something on my head. My head that should only have hair. There, something long was attached all the way to my skull.

I felt the back of my head.

There was certainly something hard there.

The shape was, as the man had said, in the shape of a horn.

“…………”

This.

What could this creation be.

I gazed forward with blank eyes.

Don’t tell me.

Before I was kidnapped, no, before I lost conscience. I was responding to a game survey on my computer.

When I opened my eyes in this cavern I had heard a faint voice…… I’m certain it whispered ‘The tutorial shall now begin’. I ignored it because I thought it was some nonsense from my dream.

The man had called me Demon Lord. There was something like a horn actually attached to the back of my head……

Game. Tutorial. Demon Lord.

These three words pointed at one possibility.

Fortunately or unfortunately, my mind quickly came to a conclusion.

“Now. Your honor, Demon Lord Dantalian. We’ll ask you only one more time.”

I couldn’t accept the answer.

The common sense, experience, and knowledge I had gained throughout my entire life completely denied the conclusion. However, as if laughing at my escape from reality, an alarm rang.

—Tirring~

White words appeared in mid-air.

[1. Accept adventurer captain Riff’s offer.]

[2. Decline adventurer captain Riff’s offer.]

“……”

I was at a lost for words.

Undeniable proof had presented itself right before me.

“Will you accept our offer? Or will you just die here. Wow. You can’t get choices as clean as this. Keke. Hurry and pick, oh honorable Demon Lord.”

The man gave an ill-tempered laugh. It was certain that the man couldn’t see the floating words.

Is it like that

Is it like that

…… is it like that.

My monologue continued and echoed in my drifting away conscience.

Like an actor who forgot his lines on stage and kept repeating his last spoken line.

I bit my lips. The taste of blood spread throughout my mouth. The vividly raw taste brought my conscience back to reality. In front of me was a barbaric man with a broad grin on his face.

Willing or not—

I’m a Demon Lord in the world of <Dungeon Attack>.

My head went cold.

As if time was flowing slowly.

“Mr. Demon Lord’s response is a bit slow.”

I gazed at the man who had just spoke.

It wasn’t only this man who had skipped shaving. The other people around us also had beards. It might be normal for these men to not shave.

‘Their outfits are old.’

‘Way too old.’

‘To be precise, I’d say about 400 years old.’

Around the time Henry the IV of France fought lively against the Roman Catholics, perhaps. The clothes looked similar to the one’s worn by the people during the French Wars of Religion. They were outfits that should have been sent straight to the museum, but no matter how you looked at these men they didn’t look like they worked at a museum.

“Are you really planning to not answer?”

Situations that couldn’t be understood until now were starting to be explained by assumptions. For example, as if a mysterious phenomenon was finally explained by the laws of physics.

“Oi, your honor Dantalian.”

Demon Lord Dantalian.

These people have been calling me Dantalian.

That was the name of the Demon Lord who showed up in <Dungeon Attack>.

There are a total of 72 Demon Lords who appear in that game. Amongst them, Dantalian was ranked 71st. He was that close to last place. Correspondingly, his level was also miserably low. In the first place, he was like a trash mob made for beginners.

Even a person playing computer games for the first time could beat him on the first run.

If I had to compare it with another game, then he was like a rabbit in the beginner field. As long as you knew how to click your mouse then you could defeat the rabbit. Dantalian was the same.

…… I should also add.

After the first run, Dantalian doesn’t appear at all in the game. He was removed in case that players got annoyed.

Imagine telling a level 20 warrior to ‘Go back to the beginner field and hunt a rabbit’. It’d be boring. Dantalian was a rabbit that you didn’t feel like fighting again.

And if I’m correct, I’m currently possessing that Dantalian.

“……”

There was a bitter taste in my mouth.

How do I get out of the evil hands of these adventurers.

I’m currently captured by humans. If this goes on I’ll probably get my head cut off or be taken to the city and executed. No matter how much I strained my brain I could only think of BAD ENDS.

Even if I proclaimed ‘I’m not Dantalian!’, I’d be grateful if I even got a sneer in response.

I couldn’t rely on Demon Lord Dantalian’s ability.

Let me rephrase that.

I could only rely on my own ability in order to overcome this obstacle.

“If you’re testing my patience right now……”

“The treasury is in Minlakdong.” (TL note: He’ll explain what this is in a short bit)

I made my resolution.

▯Adventurer, Cowardly Looter, Riff Hoffman
Empire Calender: Year 1505, Month 4, Day 4
Dantalian’s Demon Lord Castle

Looter Riff.

That was my nickname.

Despite being an adventurer, I didn’t hunt demons, but instead, looted other adventurers. That’s how I go the nickname. Well, let them call me whatever they want.

The people who honestly hunt demons are the fools, aren’t they?

The one’s who live skillfully in the world are the ones who benefits.

Using common sense, people who fought monsters like orcs and goblins are idiots. I’m saying this very seriously and sincerely.

To live a not sincere life and become a corpse, or to live a sincere life and become a cowardly looter. If I had to choose between the two, then of course I’d choose the latter. Will I still choose the latter if I die and become reincarnated? I won’t ever die.

Keke.

Regardless, light was finally shining down on my looter career.

Half a month ago, I obtained the map of Demon Lord Dantalian’s Castle. I was lucky. There was a girl too pretty to be rotting away in some lowly village. I was going to assault her a little bit, but, while presenting me this map, she pleaded, “I’ll give you this, so please spare me.”. She was a girl with beautiful red hair.

Hm? Of course assaulting a virgin is wrong.

But I really like doing bad things.

I told you already.

I’m a looter.

I don’t only loot the pockets of dead adventurers, but the virginity of all the young women in the world as well. Personally, I’d preferred to be called ‘Virginity Looter’. Something like ‘The Looter of Virginities’ sounds like a cool title. It’s good because it sounds romantic.

Thanks to this map, I was able to gather a bunch of random adventurers. Dantalian was one of the weakest Demon Lords and there was most likely no monsters in the castle. As long as we knew where to find him, then it’d be easy to capture him.

We used an artifact that detected magical energy to search inside of the cavern. We wandered the dark cave for about four hours, but our efforts weren’t in vain. We were able to capture the Demon Lord Dantalian. Amazing! The map was real!

“Look at this. This Demon Lord looks just like a caterpillar.”

My comrades were chuckling while holding the Demon Lord down.

“Looks good with his head on the ground. Let’s kill him already.”

“What do you mean, kill him!?”

I gave the person who spoke a vulgar look. You could gain a higher reward if you captured the Demon Lord alive. Also there was something we still hadn’t asked him yet. Where the treasure was.

Gain whatever information we could get. That was common sense.

First things first, we beat the Demon Lord up and then asked him where the treasury was.

But this Demon Lord, his reaction was strange.

He’d suddenly stare at an empty space and he’d narrow his brows and lower his chin as if he was in deep thought. What is this? Is he an idiot? I vaguely thought Demon Lords were supposed to be ghastly tyrants, but what is this small fry.

Well, since he was a small fry someone like me could capture him. I have no complaints. I love small fries. I’d gladly decline Demon Lords like Barbatos or Paimon.

“Mr. Demon Lord’s response is a bit slow. Are you really planning to not answer?”

I snickered and tapped the Demon Lord’s cheek.”

“Oi, your honor Dantalian.”

It was then.

“……”

It was for a mere moment, but the Demon Lord had a dreadfully spine chilling gaze.
I blinked a couple of times and after doing so, the same minor small fry-looking Demon Lord was in front of me again.

Huh?

The atmosphere changed for a brief moment.

…… was I seeing things?

Oh well. Treasure. Treasure was more important.

Let’s keep pressing this Demon Lord.

Dantalian’s Demon Lord Castle

“The treasury is in Minlakdong.”

The other party furrowed their eyebrows.

“Mayirock…… what?”

“Minlakdong. It’s at the Minlakdong.”

I told them the location of the treasury for the second time.

Honestly, I just said the name of whatever neighborhood that came to mind.
How was I supposed to know where the treasury of the Demon Lord’s castle was?

And if I sincerely answered, ‘I don’t know where it is’, I’d probably get a blade flying my way. For now, I had to say whatever I could in order to gain their interest.

I had to carefully pay attention to the men’s reactions.

“Millak, Mooirakkutoung…… the damn pronunciation is strange!”

“Do you not know of it? Here, I’ll write it down.”

Offering to write it down, I lowered my body and wrote on the cavern floor.

I didn’t have any writing utensils, but I did shed a lot of blood. Dipping my finger in my own blood, I smoothly wrote the word.

민락동
民樂洞

First line in Korean. Second line in Chinese characters.

I slightly turned my line of sight to see their reaction.

“Hey, bring the torch closer.”

“I have no idea…… were there letters like this?”

They faced each other and started talking.

“None of us here even know how to read.”

“Yeah, but the shape is completely different.”

Okay.

I generally understood the principle of the language.

I currently heard everything they said in Korean. However, when I wrote the words, they couldn’t understand.

In conclusion, just because I heard everything in Korean didn’t mean they also heard in Korean as well.

There were two possibilities.

One, the pronunciation was the same but the letters were different. Or two, both the pronunciation and letters were different but for some reason only I perceived everything in Korean.

Which one was the answer.

I decided to test it immediately.

“It’s natural for this to be unfamiliar to you gentlemen. This is ancient demon language. In order to fully secure the treasury, I had specifically used ancient demon language to magically seal the treasure.”

“Magic?”

“Yes. The vault will not open to those who do not understand the language.”

The men made a commotion.

The answer was revealed by that conversation.

We were currently talking in a language completely different from Korean, in terms of both pronunciation and letters.

How do I know this? Because I had spoken in foreign languages just now.

First sentence in English, second sentence in German, third sentence in Chinese, and fourth sentence in Japanese. And yet, these men understood me fully.

I don’t know by what principle, but the conversation was automatically being translated.

“Mr. Demon Lord. Do we, uh, need to understand that ancient demon language thing to open the vault?”

“Yes. Of course.”

“Hmmm.”

The man narrowed his brows.

— Right now this person was trying to kill me.

He promised to spare my life if I told him the location of the secret vault, but that was a big fat lie. You could tell someone was lying shamelessly by their face.

So accordingly, I had to give them a reason to keep me alive.

“Alright, honorable Demon Lord. I like this fair trade.”

The man fell for my lie nicely.

“I think we can be good friends. So, where’s this Mooirakkutoung, exactly?” (TL note: These guys are pronouncing it incorrectly)

“There’s a secret passage where I was originally at.”

“The Demon Lord’s quarters? There was nothing there when we checked.”

“That’s not so. In my quarters, it will only recognize me and open…… There’s a secret passage that only opens when I place my hand on it.”

“A magical device. Okay.”

The man grabbed my arm and forced me up.

A horrible pain spread from my right ankle. I couldn’t hold back my scream this time.

“Aaack!”

“Oh. Your leg is messed up.”

The man clicked his tongue.

“New guy! You support his honor, Dantalian.”

“Roger that, captain.”

A young man, who I assumed to be the new guy, came over to support me. He had a dagger attached to his belt. The adventurer group captain then shouted.

“Let’s get moving boys!”

The group of ten adventurers moved forward through the cave.

These men seemed to know where the Demon Lord’s quarter was. I was lucky since I had no idea where it could possibly be.

If they had told me to lead them to my quarters, I’d probably have died on the spot.

A bell rang with a ‘Tirring~’ sound.

[1. Accept adventurer captain Riff’s offer.]

[2. Decline adventurer captain Riff’s offer.]

The first choice shined brightly and then new words rose up. The choice wasn’t selected because I thought of selecting it, but rather, it was selected by my actual actions.

[Overcame the crisis with cunning eloquence.]

[Warning. Actions taken during the tutorial will henceforth affect your stats.]

I got passed the crisis.

In other words, it meant that if I didn’t lie to them then I really would have been in a fatal situation. The unnecessary remark sent a chill down my spine.

These people were not joking around.

To live or to die. That was the question.

I barely got past the first obstacle.

By any means, I had to stay alive.

♦

The adventurer group continued to walk through the cavern.

“How about just killing him now……”

“Yeah. We aren’t some group of thieves. Instead of wasting time searching for a hidden vault, we could end it here neatly……”

“I don’t know about you guys, but I agree with the captain. Nothing bad about getting a bit more money……”

I could hear the adventurers talking up ahead.

I don’t care if you’re going to discuss whether I live or die, but could you at least speak in a voice that I couldn’t hear. It’s not that hard.

They have no manners.

“Hey. Even if his leg is sprained, isn’t he a bit too slow?”

“Like I said. He’s probably stalling.”

They went as far as to flat out make sarcastic remarks.

The level of these adventurers that had captured me weren’t very good.

They radiated poorness. The blade of their weapons were jagged. It was proof that they didn’t properly maintain their gear. In the game’s standard, they’d be ranked F. The lowest adventurer group. They were around that level.

They’d get wiped by around 20 goblins.

…Although, not being able to put under command those goblins that are spread almost everywhere, was Demon Lord Dantalian’s level.

“Your honor, Demon Lord. My comrades are a bit impatient.”

The man called Riff, informed me with a snicker.

I lowered my head.

“I apologize. I’ll try harder to walk faster.”

“A nice and fast response. That’s good.”

He was talking to me like I was inferior.

I had now decided. I will definitely destroy that proud face of his. I’ll drag this man’s face in the mud.

I won’t go easy on him even if he begs for mercy later. Look forward to it, Riff.

“Us adventurers have an occupational disease. It seems they’re suspicious that your honor is trying to trick us. That you’re stalling for time to do something to us.”

“That’s impossible.”

I immediately replied.

There was no gain from telling them the truth.

Now, time to start the performance.

“I used to have subordinates as well. Goblins, imps, orcs…… nothing special, but they were still my precious subordinates. However, before you gentlemen, groups of adventurers had assaulted this castle three times in a row.”

The edge of my eye became wet.

I had the ability to cry on command. It required a little trick. It was a special move that my little sisters had taught me.

“You gentlemen are the fourth to arrive at my castle. My subordinates are all already dead. Even the little ones that have been with me for over 30 years. All of them……”

“H-Huh?”

Riff panicked.

“Surely, your honor, you aren’t crying now, are you?”

“N-No. Cry? I would never.”

I spoke like a child who was desperately trying to hold back his tears.

“It’s just that amongst them, there was a nanny who had taken care of me since I was a mere infant. Yes. She looked like an orc. That’s because she was an orc. But she took care of me sincerely. I even called her ‘mother’. A week ago, she was pierced in the chest with a spear by an adventurer and died……”

Pitiful crying echoed throughout the cave.

“Well. That, what should I say. That’s quite unfortunate. You have my condolences.”

“She held me until the very end. Even after being stabbed, even after shedding so much blood, she continued to hold me tightly to protect me from the falling arrows. Everyone, I can not forget the emotions I went through during that time no matter how hard I try……”

“……”

“She had wrapped both of her arms around me. I couldn’t see a thing, but with a thud, her body shook. Thud thud, her body kept shaking. I didn’t know what was happening at first, however, I soon found out that it was because of the arrows. Each time an arrow fell, her body would shudder. Despite that……”

Let a tear fall here once.

My act was about to reach its climax.

“Despite all that, she was looking down at me and smiling! Yes, she smiled till the very end. I wasn’t sane. I thought I was going crazy. The most precious person in the world to me was dying in front of my very eyes…… dying to protect me, she was even smiling…… What was I supposed to say!?”

I covered my face with my hands.

Weak crying leaked from between my fingers.

“I asked if it hurt. If she was in pain, but do you know what she told me in response?”

“……”

“‘I’m alright, young master’.”

The air was dead silent.

The adventurers had been captivated by my story at some point and were now quiet.

My father had trained me to be an actor since I was a child.

I went through a test at one point. Go to any cafe and talk on the phone.

In truth, no sound came from the phone, but I pretended to argue with my girlfriend.

‘I’m sorry. I’m sorry for everything.’

‘I’ll do better from now on.’

Improvised acting.

At first, the reaction from the other cafe customers was annoyance.

They were simply relaxing in a cafe and then suddenly some high school student appeared and started talking loudly on his phone. Regardless, as time past, their expressions slowly shifted. Their emotions changed.

It was sympathy.

They had experience the same thing before. They had pleaded to a loved one at a point in their life. Feeling empathy, they finally started to treat me with pity.

This was the reaction of modern people who had already experienced all kinds of stimulating romance dramas and movies.

The people of this world, who at best have only listened to the self bragging of a wandering poet, I’m sorry to say, but they were no match for me.

The fineness facial muscles
to the most detailed nuance.

Using this at my own will, I preformed passionately.

“It’s okay, she said…… and she died.”

“……”

“Now I have nothing left. I did have two goblins, but I made them leave. I don’t need them…… That’s why it’s okay to not be suspicious of me. There’s really nothing left here.”

I covered my face once again and sobbed.

My acting, which could have made a French actor cry, ended here.

In this depressing atmosphere, the adventurers had started to whisper to one another.

“Hey hey. Who made the honorable Demon Lord cry?”

“I didn’t know he had such circumstances either.”

“I was wondering why there were no guards. Other parties had already wiped this place clean.”

“So he suddenly lost everything. Tsk tsk……”

As predicted, sympathy fell upon me.

There was something I didn’t predict that happened too. It was the white notice that rose up in mid-air.

[Your devilish eloquence has captivated the people.]

[Adventurer Riff’s affection went up by 2.]

[Adventurer Dail’s affection went up by 1.]

There was an affection system as well, huh.

That made things easier.

“I am grateful to have met you all, though.”

I smiled faintly.

Giving off an atmosphere as if I had seen the sorrows and joys of life was the point.

“You didn’t kill a Demon Lord like me immediately. You showed consideration to me who was seriously injured, and are even supporting me like this. This is the first time I’ve met adventurers as gentle as you all in the entirety of my life…… I had really thought that all adventurers were villainous people like the ones who had murdered my nanny!”

That was a lie.

A flat out lie.

I knew you men were going to kill me as soon as you saw me. You probably only sheathed your weapons because you wanted the money from the treasury. A villain, as described.

However, no human could dislike being flattered. The adventurers awkwardly scratched their beards.

“No, we didn’t really do that much……”

“It’s because your honor cooperated so willingly.”

[Adventurer Riff’s affection went up by 4.]

[Adventurer Dail’s affection went up by 3.]

The other 8 adventurer’s affection went up as well.

Did their wariness go down? Compared to earlier, the amount of points that went up rose. My acting got through to them properly.

With a tear drenched face, I grinned broadly.

“I apologize for delaying everyone. Now, let us resume towards the vault.”

“……”

It wasn’t a smile out of happiness, but a forced smile to match other people. I emphasized that feeling. In order to plant the seed of guilt into them.

One of the adventurers coughed into his hand.

“Ehem. That, uh, there’s no reason for us to deliberately hurry.”

“That’s right. The vault isn’t going to grow legs and run away.”

“Since his honor’s foot hurts so much, let’s go slowly. He did say all the other demons were gone.”

The atmosphere became soft.

There was a saying that says the scariest animal on Earth were humans, but I think opposite. Humans were animals that I could feel most reassured with.

I can not trick a bear. If I encountered a wild warthog, the least a weakling like me could do was get killed.

But humans.

Humans could be deceived.

Through a performance, you could play with the hearts of others.

‘Son.’

‘You’re more of a Devil than I am.’

My father was right.

I did not want to admit it, but I had the inborn talent to deceive people.

Personally, I didn’t think it was a desirable skill. It was more appealing to sincerely gain people’s trust than through lies.

That was why I avoided using deception unless I felt like my life was in danger. Something like being good at lying, it wasn’t a skill worth bragging about.

It was the same now.

“Ah, but.”

If these adventurers had not threaten my life.

If they had approached me with a bit more politeness.

I would not have had to bare my fangs.

“Everyone— if we take too much time, other adventurer parties may arrive.”

“What?”

“As you all know, there is not even a single goblin left in my castle. As much as it is an empty castle, other adventurers will probably come for the treasure vault as well. This may trouble you all……”

The adventures gave each other unsettled looks.

There were no monsters in this castle. Even if there were some left, these men could use me, the Demon Lord, as a hostage to drive them back. However, there was something more dangerous than monster.

Other humans.

Adventurers competed against other adventurers rigorously. Treasure hidden in the Demon Lord’s castle. The bounty on the Demon Lord’s head…… anyone would want to get their hands on these. Even if they had to kill other humans.

In <Dungeon Attack>, the hero didn’t fight only demons. There were many adventurer parties that attacked in attempt to take the hero’s wealth. They only claimed to be adventurers, but they were no different to a group of thieves.

“Damn it. I didn’t consider that.”

“There’s no certainty that other adventurers will come.”

The men started to frown. They had taken in seriously my lie.

“Dumbass. Did you not hear that this place was assaulted 3 times already? Other wolves, who’ve heard the rumor will come.”

“Not good. This is not good…… We just caught the Demon Lord and you’re now telling me to risk my life to fight other lively adventurers? Don’t joke with me.”

“Shit. Like we’d hand him over to a bunch of dogs.”

These were adventurers, who had just left their hometowns for the first time to get rich quick. They couldn’t contain their excitement when they were presented the opportunity to turn their lives around.

“Everyone.”

I spoke in a calm voice. Their gaze naturally collected onto me.

“At this moment, other adventurers may already be approaching. How about making our way to the vault first? There’s not a lot of time. We can discuss things while moving.”

The men glanced at each other once more and nodded all together.

“His honor is right. Let’s take the treasure first. Yeah!”

“Let’s get a move on! We don’t have the right to show our faces in Jalsen without a few scratches or two.”

With loud voices, the adventurers resumed their march.

Good.

This was enough for now.

I gave them an agreeable suggestion. Their guard against Demon Lord Dantalian may not be completely gone, but at least they don’t see me as an ‘enemy’ now. Their affection continued to rise. That was a good sign……

“New guy, carry his honor on your back. That’ll be faster.”

“Roger that, captain!”

The man lifted me up promptly.

“Ah, thank you very much.”

“What do you eat normally to be so light? You look fine on the outside but it’s like your insides are empty.”

As if I weighed nothing, the man walked with light steps. I suddenly ended up getting a piggy back ride, but this was much better than forcing myself to walk.

I guess you could say that I got passed the second obstacle.

I was required to open the treasure vault, hence giving them a reason to keep me alive. Furthermore, I was able to raise their affection towards me, giving them the false impression that I was on their side. It was favorable. However, there were still two problems remaining.

The first problem was that I had no idea if a treasury existed at all. As soon as they find out that I lied, regardless of affection points or whatever, they’ll murder me.

The other problem was getting rid of the adventurers. If I couldn’t solve these two problems then my fate will always lead to death.

‘Base status’

I moved my lips slightly and whispered.

Nothing happened.

Without being discouraged, I kept experimenting.

‘Dungeon status, dungeon situation…… Mm. Not this either, huh.’

I currently  had the ability to access the game system.

It was merely an assumption, but I should be able to use the other status windows than just affection points. For example, being able to see the map of the castle. I was aiming for that.

My prediction was soon confirmed.

‘Demon Lord Castle Status.’

With a ‘tirring~’, a sound rang in my head.

White words appeared before me.

    Dantalian’s Demon Lord Castle
    Type: Cave
    Title: None
    Rank: F
    Special Effect: None
    Military Force: None
    Citizens: None
    Wealth: 100 Libra
    ※The castle is in ruins. Neighborhood kids refer to this place as a fun playground. This place is in danger of being conquered at any moment. Urgently open the ‘Employment Tab’ and hire forces.

 Is that so. At the very most, this was it.

I was hoping that perhaps even a little amount of forces remained, but there really was nothing left. This really was nothing more than a kiddy playground.

I was grateful that I had any wealth at all.

‘Libra’ was the name of the common currency in <Dungeon Attack>. There was a time I was bored and decided to compare currencies. In Korean money, 1 libra was 500,000 won(TL note: 433USD).
Right now I had 100 libra.

In other words, I was given about 50,000,000won(TL note: 43,335 USD).

How far could I get with this.

After searching through all kinds of functions in the game, I finally found what I wanted.

‘Employment Tab’.

A half transparent list appeared before me.

……

So weak.

And damn expensive.

No matter how you looked at it, 200,000 won for a slime was overcharging. In this day and age, you could buy two fair cows with 200,000 won. Not calves, but cows. How could a useless slime be twice the price of a cow used for farm work?

Most likely, the price went up because of the game difficulty.

‘Tsk. This messes up my plan……’

At first, I was thinking of pouring my wealth into hiring a unit of monsters. Even if I spent all my money and hired 8 goblin deserters, the chances of them winning against the adventurers was uncertain.

No, these men might be more pathetic than I think. Was it worth testing out?

‘Status’.

I muttered in my mind while staring at an adventurer.

[You do not have sufficient affection with this person.]

[Only the simplest stats will be viewable.]

With the same ‘tirring~’ sound from before, a window appeared above the adventurer’s head.

I assumably needed more affection points to see more precise information.

    Name: Riff Hoffman
    Stamina: E
    Attack: E
    Defense: E
    Affection: 6

“Uhg”

I unintentionally let out a groan.

A little bit stronger than a goblin.

He was certainly weak, but that small difference was a big matter to me. The other adventurers had about the same stats. Even if I hired 8 goblins, they were far off from being able to overwhelm these adventurers.

What to do.

There was no certainty in winning or losing. Should I leave it to fate and take a gamble? To risk my life on a gamble. That wasn’t my style. I preferred to raise my chances in winning before going into a fight.

As I was in deep thought.

“We’re almost there!”

An adventurer shouted.

We were almost at the Demon Lord’s room.

“Hah. Why is this cave so big?”

“This is your first time coming to a Demon Lord’s Castle. This is nothing. Normally these castles are full of traps, so you have to tread incredibly slowly.”

The adventurers were chatting rowdily.

There wasn’t much time left. I had to make a decision soon.

Should I make it up by numbers and hire a lot of slimes or fairies? Or, should I hire the strongest golem and attack them by surprise? No. Both sides were far away from being ‘certain victory’. If I allow myself to get in danger……

……Okay. This was the best option.

“Alright! Let’s go in.”

The adventurers poured into the room.

I bit my lips forcefully. Skin tore and blood flowed into my mouth.

If I had to rate my chances, then 70%. It was pathetically low for something that had my life on the line. Regardless, this was the utmost best.

I thought I was free once my father had died. I ran away hoping that I could live a peaceful life.

I got this far and you’re telling me that my life was in danger again? To fall into a strange world and to tell me to die without a single clue on what’s going on just because I had become a Demon Lord? Don’t make me laugh!

Who cares if I’m a Demon Lord or something. If there was a fellow that was trying to end my idle life, then I’ll face them with no mercy. I will live no matter what……

♦

The Demon Lord’s room was a miserable wreck.

“Is there really treasure here?”

This place had most likely been plundered many times already. Be it the bed or the chairs, the wooden furniture were toppled over. It was hard to believe that there was a treasure vault in this mess.

The captain, Riff, spoke.

“Your honor. Hurry up and open up that Mooirakkutoung or whatever.”

I nodded.

“Yes. Do not worry. I know that…… ack!”

I fell over while getting off the new guy’s back. I had twisted my ankle on purpose.

The adventurers reacted in panic.

“Ouch, are you okay?”

“Hey! Support him properly!”

“I-I’m okay. I’m alright.”

I stood up by myself with trembling legs. The core point of acting was to obtain sympathy. If I borrowed another person’s shoulder here, there’s the danger that they might see me as an annoying wounded person.

I went to a wall while limping.

“Everyone, it is here.”

“Ah? All I see is a wall.”

“There’s a carving here only visible to Demon Lords. If you place your hand on the carving and recite a specific spell, then the vault will open.”

I lied without missing a beat.

The adventurers had intrigued expressions on their faces.

“Oh. Magic, huh.”

Beginner adventurers were ignorant in regards to magic, like these adventurers who originally used to be simple farmers or lumberjacks until now. The majority of these men most likely haven’t seen proper magic in their entire life. If I told them it was magic, then they’d simply nod and say “Is that so.”.

I made a request while displaying a pained face.

“Everyone. I’m sorry, but please move 10 steps away from me.”

“Why?”

“Only a Demon Lord can release the magic on the vault. It will never unlock if even one outsider is nearby. If a mistake were to happen, a defense mechanism could occur and you may be hurt.”

“A defense mechanism, you say……”

“Worst case scenario, the treasure could be sealed forever.”

The adventurer’s face immediately turned grave.

As if I had just threatened to take their treasure away from these humans turned money grubbers, the effect was instant. Following my instructions, all 10 men stood in a line and backed off.

One step. Another step.

The adventurers spoke after taking exactly 10 steps.

“How is that. 10 steps, just like you asked.”

“……”

These adventurers were sincere in useless places.

I was in awe, but expression wise, I continued to smile firmly.

“That’s exactly 10 steps. No more and no less. There is a good chance that you all will not be affected by the magic at that range. Well done.”

The adventurers grinned broadly.

“This is nothing.”

“I’m a bit of a perfectionist.”

I think they wholeheartedly believed that.

I’m struck with wonder whenever I meet humans as self-confident as these guys. Humans, with this kind of brain, were able to be separated from Homo sapiens sapiens.

Wouldn’t this be considered a kind of miracle?

I turned my back towards them and faced the wall.

“I shall now begin casting the spell. Everyone, please be silent!”

Obviously, there was no carving on the wall. The fact that the treasury was here was a blatant lie, like I’ve been saying.

But there was something I did believe in.

‘Demon Lord Castle’s Wealth.’

White words appeared on the smooth wall.

    Demon Lord Castle’s Wealth
    Withdrawal Amount: xxx Libra
    Total Balance: 100 Libra
    ※Warning. If you withdraw too much at once, you may go bankrupt.

This was one of the game functions I found earlier.

Thanks to the Demon Lord’s right, I could withdraw funds wherever and whenever I wanted. It’d all be over if I took out a bunch of coins here.

However, it’d be troubling to simply hand over the money.

A small performance.

Add some spice and gift-wrapping.

Taking in a deep breath— as seriously as I could, I shouted.

“Mahabanyabaramildashimgyeong……!”

…… ……

…… I honestly did shout this seriously.

It was back when I wrote Minlakdong on the ground. The conversations were certainly being translated, but the adventurers could not exactly pronounce the word ‘Minlakdong’. Hence, all the conversations weren’t being translated cleanly.

“Gwanjajaebosal Hengshimbanyabaramildashi Jogyeonohoengaegoeng Doilchaegoaek, Sarija, Saekbeuligoen Goengbeulisaek Saekjeukshigeong Geongjeukshisaek Soosanghaengshik Yeokbooyeoshi……” (TL note: If you’re genuinely curious as to what he’s chanting, it’s the famous ‘Heart Sutra‘ in Manayana Buddhism. Don’t expect me to translate it because even professional translators are struggling to do so.)

For example, words that couldn’t be translated into this world’s language; chemical formulas like H2O or professional terms like ‘Deformation‘, could not be translated. Furthermore, words that I perceived as proper nouns weren’t translated either. This was the reason why the adventurers had no idea what Minlakdong meant. Things like Mahabanyabaramildashimgyeon were the same.

Despite the fact that Minlak had the meaning of ‘citizen happiness’, it was not converted. Even banyabalamildashimgyeon could be interpreted, but it wasn’t to these men.

The reason behind this was because I wasn’t saying these words with the meaning in mind.

Thus.

“T-That’s the demon language?”

“I have no idea what he’s saying but it sounds menacing.”

“I feel like something is making my heart tremble……”

To the adventurers, it would really seem like I was shouting an unknown incantation.

“Beobgoensang Beulsaenbeulmyeol Beulgeuboojeong Boojeunbeulgam Shigo Geongjeongmoosaek……”

While I used my mouth to keep chanting, I used my eyes to earnestly stare at the window.

I had to slowly time when to take the money out.

    Demon Lord Castle’s Wealth
    Withdrawal Amount: 79 Libra
    Total Balance: 21 Libra
    ※Warning. If you withdraw too much at once, you may go bankrupt.

I decided to take out about 8/10 of all I had.

It’d probably be suspicious if I withdrew a solid amount of 80, so I purposely set it to 79.

 “Ajaeajae Baraajae Baraseunajae Moji Sabaha—!”

I lifted my arms up and yelled gloriously.

As I said the last line of the incantation, I thought the word ‘withdraw’ in my mind.

Then, silver coins formed in mid-air and fell.

“S-Silver! It’s silver!”

“How much is all that!?”

“It really was magic!”

5 silver coins equalled 1 gold coin. In total, 395 silver coins rained down. The average farmer in <Dungeon Attack> made around 15 silver a year.

Meaning, this was a jackpot for the adventurers.

“Oh! Ooooooh……!”

Silver coins were forming a heaping pile on the floor.

80% of my entire fortune was pulled out in an instant.

Their bodies were probably burning up from seeing so much money rain in front of them.

“Hey. You guys haven’t forgotten that we’re splitting this up equally for each of us, right?”

“Of course. Whoever tries to change their word now, I’ll kill you!”

The adventurers stared at the silver with bloodshot eyes.

The smell of greed flowed from their mouths.

    Demon Lord Castle’s Wealth
    Withdrawal Amount: xx Libra
    Total Balance: 21 Libra
    ※Warning. If you withdraw too much at once, you may go bankrupt.

The final coin dropped.

Like a bunch of wolves, the adventurers tried to rush forward.

What impatient men.

Aiming for when they took their first step— I raised my hand quickly.

“Do not approach yet! You’ll be cursed!”

“C-Curse?”

Hearing the disturbing word, they came to a halt.

I fell to my knees
and as if I was under some intense pain, I started to groan.

“Gaaaah……!”

I contorted my face as much as I could.

Foam overflowed from my mouth.

The adventurers were startled by the sudden situation.

“W-What’s going on!? What’s going on, your honor!?”

“It’s black magic! He’s been cursed by black magic!”

The men stumbled back in fear.

In order to make my performance seem more real, I collided my already broken ankle on the ground. Pain vibrated through me. An agonizing scream ruptured from my lungs.

“Aack— Kuaaaaaaaaaaaaah!”

I cried out while grabbing my eye sockets. While doing so, I took a glimpse at the adventurers from between my fingers. Their faces were pale. There were even some men trying to make a run for it. My greatest performance was working.

“Oh God. That’s terrible……”

“Just what’s happening? Are you okay!?”

One of the braver adventureres tried to approach me, but I hurried prevented him from doing so.

“S-Stay back! This is the consequence for using black magic…… If you get close, aaagh, you could be affected as well…… kuh, gaah!”

“Hiiih!”

The man stopped promptly.

The adventurers had watched silver coins appear out of thin air. To them this was magic. They could do nothing but believe that whatever I told them was magic was true.

The adventurers started to mutter to each other.

“By any chance. Did he tell us to take 10 steps back…… for our sake?”

“It was his chance to get rid of us……”

Yes.

This was the response I wanted.

If my plan was going to work, I had to raise their affection rate towards me as high as possible. And what would leave the strongest impression on someone?

When someone sacrifices oneself to save them.

Like right now.

“Huaaaaaaak!”

I writhed in pain more intensely.

“W-Wait. He’ll die at this rate! Are you sure we shouldn’t stop him!?”

“You idiot, did you not hear him say it was black magic? Have you not heard the stories of people dying by some weird curse!?”

“Dail is right. The only thing we can do is…… regrettably, wait here patiently.”

“Damn it.”

Some of the adventurers cursed angrily.

At this point, notice windows popped up continuously.

[Your devilish performance has captivated the people.]

[Adventurer Riff’s affection went up by 15.]

[Adventurer Dail’s affection went up by 13.]

[Adventurer Zed’s affection went up by 19.]

Perfect.

As intended, a sharp increase in affection.

With my nails, I ripped some skin off of my face. Red blood spurted out. It was incredibly painful, however this was light compared to the weight of my life. My screams continued on for a while.

Moments later.

I let out a ragged breath.

“It’s, okay now…… You can collect the coins now…… it’s fine.”

“Mm.”

“E-Ehem.”

They’re attitude had completely changed.

The wolves that desperately wanted to swallow up the coins earlier were nowhere to be seen now. The adventurers were all afraid that the coins might still be cursed.

“You go first and check.”

“No no. You know the saying ‘respect your elders’, the oldest should go.”

The men presented the chance to go first to one another, but never taking it themselves.

Having enough, the party leader stood forward.

“Screw it! You’re all cowards! I don’t know why you have anything down there. I should probably chop it off with my axe. You were all confident in conquering a Demon Lord’s Castle, but look at you all now!”

The leader of this party, Riff, roared.

“And Dail, you one-eyed person. You’ve been with me for 2 years now. What are you doing hiding with those greenhorns!”

“Well, this is my first time witnessing black magic.”

“Oh, look at you still making excuses. What’s a fellow, who’s a senior, doing cowering like a newbie!”

“Then you go first.”

“Yeah. The captain should go first.”

The other men nodded in agreement.

Riff twitched his nose.

“I was going to even if you didn’t tell me, you cowards.”

Riff walked proudly towards the pile of silver.

The adventurers whispered to one another while watching their captain march.

“He’s being prideful again.”

“He’s got his nose bent plenty of times while acting proud, too.”

“What’d you say!?”

Riff glared at them. His bear-like face looked like some vandal when he scowled. The men avoided his glare and whistled.

Riff turned back to the silver pile.

“Hoo… hoo…… Here I go!”

He reached out and grabbed a coin.

It was obvious, but absolutely nothing happened. There was no black magic in the first place.

Not knowing this fact, Riff exaggeratedly laughed mockingly at the others.

“Look at that! Didn’t his honor, Demon Lord, already say that there was no curse now? Idiots, I should just cut your dicks off now! Kekeke!”

“……”

The adventurers glanced at each other awkwardly.

Watching the chain of events from a distance, I couldn’t help but mockingly smirk.

I wonder if it was because I had acquired enough affection, but I could see more detailed information on Riff’s status window. There, I could see the mental state of Riff that he wasn’t voicing.

    Name: Riff Hoffman
    Race: Human
    Job: Lumberjack(B) Adventurer(F)
    Reputation: Dust in the galaxy
    Leadership: E \ Might: E \ Intelligence: F
    Politics: F \ Charm: F \ Technique: E
    Affection: 21
    Current Mental State: ‘Ah, shit. I thought my liver was going to fall out. My legs are still shaking……!’

It was a bluff.

Well done scolding your subordinates when you were also trembling in fear. The other adventurers, not having realized this, were scratching the back of their heads.

“T-Then let’s go as well.”

“Mm. The captain did prove it to us.”

“Lesser people like us should follow his lead.”

The men approached the pile carefully.

“Hah. You sorry batch of men.”

Riff was sneering but he didn’t try to stop the other adventurers from approaching in particular.

Following after, the other adventurers started feeling up the coins greedily. In case someone tried to take more coins than they should, the adventurers watched each other intently.

“If there’s a single coin in your backpocket, I’ll beat you up personally.”

“Split everything equally. Don’t try to be a thief!”

Quite a lot of time had passed before they had finally counted all the coins.

Riff snorted with satisfaction.

“Hu. In total there’s 386 silver coins.”

Huh.

I narrowed my brows a bit. I’m certain I had taken out 395 silver coins.

Where’d the remaining 9 go to.

“……”

“……”

A couple of the men were fidgeting nervously.

……So they couldn’t hold back and managed to steal some. Despite the fact that they kept threatening each other, there were some people who were able to successfully steal in the end. How marvelous.

“Alright. Let’s fairly split up 38 pieces each.”

“Then there’ll be 6 remaining. What about the change?”

“What about it? I, the captain. will take it.”

Riff shamelessly declared.

 The other adventurers booed and sent jeers.

“Captain was the one that said to divide equally no matter what, in the first place!”

“That’s dirty. Dirty!”

“Shut up you swines! If it wasn’t for me, you cowards wouldn’t have approached the money at all.”

“That’s that and this is this!”

“What’s that and what’s this! Speak clearly!”

Beginner adventurer party had met internal conflict so soon.

It was like an argument between kids.

After a lively debate, it was decided that Riff would take the change.

“Tsk tsk. A bunch of narrow-minded bigots.”

Riff grumbled. It seemed that he got offended that the others were so against conceding the leftover 6 pieces of silver to him, the captain. I couldn’t tell who the narrow-minded person was.

Anyways, it was starting to become time.

“Everyone.”

I opened my mouth.

“I’m sorry to disturb you all while you’re busy, but I have something to tell you all.”

“Hm? Oh, what is it?”

Their response was half-hearted. The adventurers were occupied shoving their portion of the coins into their bags or shoes. Some of them were even loosening their belts to shove the silver into their underwear. It was quite dirty.

“I apologize, but the event we had feared has occurred. Just now, other adventurer parties has invaded the castle.”

“……”

Their hands froze immediately.

“What?”

“I am a Demon Lord. There’s a magic system set up that notifies me whenever someone invades my castle. A moment ago, I heard a bell ring in my head.”

The adventurer’s eyes opened wide in panic.

“D-Demon Lord, is that true?”

“Yes. Unfortunately, this is the truth.”

“Isn’t there the chance that you heard wrong?”

“……Of course, there is the possibility. I too am hoping that I heard wrong. However, I’ve heard the same bell ring 4 times this month. To be mishearing things now is very unlikely.”

I confessed to them with a sad expression.

The men were visibly shaken. While I acted, there were times that I felt like I could see other people’s emotions in the shape of a thick cloud. I was touching that cloud here and there and forming it to my will.

“T-The numbers. Do you know how many people?”

“Not exactly. I could take a guess by counting the rings……”

I bit my lips, giving off the feeling that the number was hard to reveal. Seeing this, the adventurers grew more anxious.

“I don’t care if it’s an estimate! Just tell us how many there are!”

“……The bell rang 3 times in a row.”

“What does that mean?”

“The bell rings once every 10 people who invade my castle. In other words, at the very least, 30 people has invaded.”

Thirty people.

An amount of people too large for the people in front of me to handle.

The adventurers became pale.

Empire Calender: Year 1505, Month 4, Day 4
Dantalian’s Demon Lord Castle

Ο

I didn’t like the situation at all.

According to what the Demon Lord had said, there was another group of invading adventurers in the cave. The number was at the very least, 30. This was no joke…… damn it.

I had picked weaklings on purpose to bring here. People with skill demanded more money. In the case of my adventurer group, the treasure in the vault was to be split fairly, but the bounty on the Demon Lord Dantalian was all mine for the taking. If I wanted to establish this kind of agreement, I could only gather these run of the mill adventurers.

Shit. I should have just spent more money and hired skilled people. No, even if I did, 30 people was too much. They wouldn’t be able to handle this amount. My insides were strangely bitter……

“We could win if we hold out in this room!”

“Are you insane. It’s 30 people, thirty! We’ll be overwhelmed!”

“If you’re going to fight, then leave me out. I never had the hobby of killing myself. I’ll get out on my own.”

“Hah! This filthy coward! Finally showing your true colors!”

The men were split into two groups and arguing.

People who wanted to stay here and fight, and people who wanted to escape. They had been arguing for over 10 minutes now, but they were yet to come together like they did before.

Honestly, I didn’t have a good idea either. Obviously we should run, but there was no certainty that we wouldn’t meet the other adventurer party on the way out. That was the problem. Crap, what do I have to do to get out safely……

……wait.

Think about it the other way around.

If we had to face them then face them. It’s fine as long as I get away safely. It’s not my problem if the others live or die.

I took out a map and checked. There were 3 routes from here to the cave entrance.

I approached the Demon Lord and asked him.

“Hey, your honor. How many paths are there that leads from the castle entrance to here?”

“There are 3.”

As expected, the map was accurate. Even the Demon Lord confirmed it.

“Do you know which route they’re coming from?”

“I’m sorry, but I can’t tell that far……”

The Demon Lord spoke with an ashamed expression.

“No, it’s fine. I’m grateful you even told me about the invaders.”

I lightly patted the Demon Lord’s shoulder. Once doing so, he lowered his head graciously.

I said this before, but this guy really has no guts. Even though he’s a Demon Lord, he’s been speaking respectfully to a human like me. Does he have no pride? To say it nicely, he knows his place. What more would he get then get hit if he showed defiance. Kekeke.

At that moment, the Demon Lord looked straight at my eyes. He appeared weirdly serious so I couldn’t help but become stiff in response.

“Sir Riff. I’m fated to be captured by adventurers no matter what.”

“Hm? So?”

“Then, I at least wish to choose a safer path. You all did not kill me the moment you saw me. Just that alone makes me wish to be on your side. Please live, and make a wise decision.”

Aha.

He was begging for me to save his life.

I started to feel familiarity with the little one in front of me. Pride wasn’t needed if it meant survival. I thought so as well.

“Hehe. You sure know your stuff, your honor. Okay, don’t worry. If you believe in me then you will definitely get to the city safely.”

“Thank you. Thank you very much……”

It was cute because he looked like a pet, lowering his head over and over again like that.

I tapped the Demon Lord’s cheek while chuckling. It was a sign of affection. It’s okay to be happy.

I shouted at the men that were still arguing.

“Attention!”

They shut their mouths. I guess they realized that there was no point in fighting each other. They glared this way with bloodshot eyes.

“We’re retreating.”

“But captain!”

“Listen up you greenhorns. Are you not able to see properly because of the coins in your pockets? Who do you think you are? You guys only faced 2 goblins on our way here. How do you plan to face 30 adventurers with just that ability?”

I gave them a menacing look.

I’ve grown up being told that I had a vulgar looking face. There was no one here that was brave enough to face me properly.

“Stop dreaming. You’ll die without being able to do anything.”

“……but captain. There’s no guarantee that things will go well if we escape.”

The person to speak was the one who was silent and didn’t get involved in the argument.

This bald one-eyed man was a reasonably skilled senior.

“What are you going to do if we unluckily meet the enemy? We could at least hold out here and fend them off, but there’s no answer if we meet them out there.”

“I know, you bastard. That’s why we’ll split up and go down three separate paths.”

“Three separate paths?”

“There’s three routes from here to the castle entrance. Pick your path and run that way.”

A moment of silence passed.

The men creased their brows.

“……captain. Surely you don’t mean.”

“Yeah. One of the three groups will meet the enemy no matter what. However, oppositely, the other two groups will live.”

“That’s just an escape-goat!”

The one-eyed man retorted loudly. He must have been seriously enraged because the veins on his neck were visible. Tsk, he’s a good guy but the places he got serious at made it tiring.

The other guys complained as well, saying things like “That’s not right!” and “We’d rather all die together!”.

A bunch of peerless fools they were. You all don’t know what death means. That’s why you’re easily able to say that you’re willing to die together.

……but there was no benefit in speaking truthfully here. Let’s talk while mixing lies here and there. What? I’m only honest to myself. I never said that I was honest with other people as well, did I?

“Shut up you punks! My job is to send as many people as I can back home!”

They twitched. Would you look at that. They got scared just because I shouted a bit. There’s a limit to expectations if they thought they could fight 30 people with this attitude.

“You guys all have a family, right? Man’s pride? That’s good. Companionship? That’s also nice. But what’s the point of worrying about all that if we end up dead, huh? Who’s going to take responsiblity of your families?”

“……”

“What about your kids? What about the fellow village people working in the fields in our stead? What about your wives?”

A complicated silence fell upon them.

As expected, there’s nothing as persuasive as family. Even though I was illiterate, I at least knew how to deal with people.

“The one’s who are alive will take responsibility for the families of the one’s that have fallen.”

I made my words a notch softer and concluded.

“We have no more corners to back up to, you punks. Think about your families and the village. Everything else is useless. Forget it all and only think of your families……”

They lowered their heads.

Of course. If you thought with reason then my suggestion was the best. It was just the fact that they had to sacrifice someone else’s life that was hard to accept. They had to cut off that part of their minds.

The adventurers separated into 3 units.

4, 3, 3 people each.

“Let’s get going now.”

I ordered sternly.

Which route met with the enemy, that all relied on luck. Well, if you asked if it really was entirely based on luck then that wasn’t right.

I purposely placed the Demon Lord in another group. If the enemy had a magical energy detecting device then it would react to the Demon Lord. The target will naturally go to him. In other words, he worked as bait. I was good at using my head in this kind of places.

Alright. Time to genuinely run away.

Please die, my close comrades.

So that way, I can live.
▯Weakest Demon Lord, Rank 71st, Dantalian
Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 4, Day 4
Dantalian’s Demon Lord Castle

The adventurers patted each other’s shoulders lightly. They then departed down their own path out of the three.

“Go and die, you dogs.”

“You’ll be the one dying. I’ll make sure to enjoy your wife in your stead.”

The adventurers swearing at each other was simply a coping method. They knew that if their farewells were heavy then their feet would be heavy as well.

The leader of the unit I was with spoke.

“We should get going as well.”

“Yeah.”

I was on the back of the new guy again.

The unit I was with specially had 4 members. It was because they had extra luggage to carry, which was me. The person that was temporarily acting as leader was the one-eyed bald man. The person who refuted against Riff earlier.

“……”

“……”

Gloomy footsteps echoed throughout the cavern.

Not a single person said a word. The shadow of people reflected on the cavern wall by the torches. The shadows wavered like a mirage.

When Riff suggested to divide the group into three, I honestly wanted to run around in joy. That was the idea I was originally going to propose. I was afraid of a group of 10 adventurers together, but I didn’t fear a group split up into 3’s and 4’s.

They were foolish.

Riff suggested to split up in order to raise his chances of survival as much as possible, however, he was mistaken from the premise. He completely believed the words of a Demon Lord. Normally, adventurers and Demon Lords were supposed to be hostile to one another, but they had easily trusted my information.

Were they being careless, or did I really appear to be that pitiful. If it was the latter, then that was a relief. It was proof that my acting skills weren’t rusty yet. The price to pay for being careless shall be huge, Riff.

I stared at the empty space in front of me.

A half transparent map was being projected. Red dots had split down three separate paths and were drifting away from each other.

Amongst the functions in the system, there was the ability to see a map. Conveniently, the adventurers were displayed as red dots and even showed their current positions.

There was a thick cavern wall between each routes. There were pathways that connected the routes at a couple of places, but only I, who had the system map, knew this. The adventurers had no means of communication whatsoever.

Even if a massacre was to occur.

‘Employment Tab.’

I spoke in my mind.

A ridiculously cheerful ‘tirring~’ sound effect rang.

Griid

For a slight moment.

It was probably for only an instant, but there was hesitation in my eyes.

The adventurers had split themselves up into 3 groups. They trusted the Demon Lord Dantalian when they should have been hostile against him. They had not only lowered their fighting prowess, but they were mentally unprepared as well.

The optimum requirement for a surprise attack.

But the reason why I was hesitating for a moment…… who knows.

If I hired monsters and attacked the adventurers here, then I’d be crossing the Rubicon River(TL note: point of no return). For the adventurers to die or for myself to die. Only one of the two future existed. There was no going back.

“……”

The inside of my mouth felt dry.

It was impossible to return once I’ve made my decision.

I was realizing the weight of my choice.

Then, the second choice box since coming to this world had appeared.

[1. Annihilate the adventurers like this.]

[2. Be taken by the adventurers like this.]

…… just as I thought. I figured out in what situations these choices appeared.

When my life was on the line, or when other people’s lives were on the line. These boxes popped up in those immensely vital points, as if telling me to really think about my decision carefully.

Regardless, my obvious choice was option number 1.

A hopeful future for a Demon Lord captured by humans did not exist. Even if the adventurers decided not to kill me, it was useless. The adventurers will sell me over to the city in order to gain the bounty, and then my head will be displayed on the town square to show off to the people about how well the cutting off of my head was done.

So thus, I selected number 1.

I’ll kill every last human before me.

‘Hire Weak Golem.’

[You’ve hired a Weak Golem.]

[Would you like to summon Weak Golem?]

My entire fortune of 21 Libra shrunk down to a single Libra in an instant.

At the same moment, the cave floor was covered in light.

“H-Huuh?”

“What’s going on!?”

The adventurers panicked.

The light caused by the summoning circle lit up the dark cavern entirely for a brief second. The moment everyone’s gaze was focused on the circle, I bared my teeth.

CRUUUNCH! (TL note: If you know a better word to portray biting down onto something, be my guest)

It sounded like a plastic bag was being ripped. However, it was something much more raw than a plastic bag. With my teeth, I had bit down strongly onto the ear of the newbie adventurer who was carrying me.

“Kuaaaaaah!”

The adventurer cried out and flailed his body. I, who was on his back, fell to the floor. I was already preparing a safe way to fall, so the impact wasn’t too big.

“J-Jack!? What happened! What’s wrong!?”

“Guh, ah, ear! My ear!”

The vision that was focused on the summoning circle moved to here.

With a genuinely fearful expression, I pointed towards the other side.

“Everyone! Behind you! Look behind you!”

In the spot I was pointing at was an arm made of stone reaching out from the earth.

The stone arm grasped the ground and, like a demon coming out of Hell itself, a bulky body emerged. A disturbing ‘grrrrdduh, grduh’ sound resonated. It was the sound of boulders grinding against each other. The adventurers stared at the summoning magic with their mouths agape.

“M-My God……”

“Raise your shields! Take out your swords!”

The adventurers were moving about in confusion. Nevertheless, the bald one-eyed man, proving that he wasn’t just the sub-captain by name, gave orders to his comrades. However, your enemy wasn’t only the golem that had suddenly appeared.

“Mmmm……!?”

I jumped back onto the back of the new guy and covered his mouth. The man opened his eyes widely.

His eyes looked like they were shouting, ‘What are you doing!?’.

He had a dagger on his hip that I had been eyeing since the beginning. I pulled his dagger out and brought it down on his throat. Once, twice, thrice, and finally for the fourth time. I didn’t even give him the opportunity to resist.

“Eub, pbb…… huppbb……”

The newbie screamed, but the sound was muffled by my hand making it only sound like a moan.

Soon the groans became bright red blood and drenched my hand stickily.

“Uuh……eub……”

I silently stared down at the new guy’s eyes.

Finally, his body went limp.

This took 8 seconds.

The other adventurers had no idea that the newbie was murdered behind them.

Thus, I had committed my first murder, but I didn’t have time to get sentimental. The situation was still dire. I immediately hid the dagger in my clothes and turned my head.

“∎∎∎∎∎∎—!”

Right on time, the golem had climbed out fully.

As if celebrating the fact that it had escaped from the stifling underground world, the golem raised its head and let out a long roar. The ceiling of the cave shook, making the stalactites tremble as well. Even if it was called ‘weak golem’, at this moment, the one dominating this space was that monster.

This was a monster.

This was a demon.

It looked so much different from humans and that atrocious outer appearance was enough to plant fear into the hearts of humans.

“Hiiiik……!”

The adventurers shrunk back. One man’s arms were trembling so much that he had dropped his torch. Since the light from the summoning circle was gone, the cavern had returned back to being dark— that raised the adventurer’s fears to no limit. The light from the torch gave the cave a reddish glow, giving only slight glimpses of that massive body in the distant darkness.

People who used to do farm work for a living in their hometown.

These people may have been realizing for the first time.

That adventurer was a discreditable occupation that normally faced against mythical terrors like this.

“E-Euuuuh……”

The three adventurers gathered together. This was an instinct implanted into humans, to unite together with their comrades when facing a large beast. However, in this situation that instinct had made them commit a grave mistake.

“∎∎, ∎∎∎∎∎∎∎—!”

As big as the golem was, its footsteps were slow.

If the adventurers had spread out instead of grouping together, then they may have been able to deal with the golem. But these men lacked experience. Experience of fighting various types of demons.

Like a tank, the golem advanced towards the men. Its feet came down with a thud and shook the ground. The tremors violently jolted the darkness.

The adventurers could do nothing but hold up their wooden shields. Their entire body had become rigid. They should probably be complimented for not having run away on the spot.

“T-This person is dead!”

I intensely shook the already disordered adventurers by another level. I was holding up the new guy’s chest and shouting.

“He suddenly fell! It’s black magic! Someone unbeknownst to me is assaulting everyone! Quickly, please get away!”

“What……”

A moment of unrest.

However, faltering for even a second while a golem was right in front of you, that was more than enough time to bring about a tragic end.

The adventurers’ attention was dispersed. Aiming for that chance, the golem swung its fist. The target was the bald one-eyed man. As the person responsible for this unit, when he had heard that the new guy had died, he had turned this way for a brief second. The golem’s heavy stone fist smashed into his body just like that.

There wasn’t even a shout.

His skull was crushed and he was met with instant death.

The wooden shield which the village blacksmith had made was of no use.

“………… uh, aah?”

One step late, the survivors reacted.

Honestly, to say that it was a proper reaction was miserable.

One adventurer, as if giving up on all hope, fell to his knees. The other adventurer decided oppositely and was about to escape. Tossing away his torch and sword, he got rid of anything that was weighing him down and ran.

It’d be troubling if I missed one person here.

“This way! Run this way!”

“Uh, ah! Aah!”

Giving me an obscure response, the adventurer ran towards me. It was like the behavior unconsciously taken by people during a fire. When told to escape this way, they ran towards that direction recklessly.

I pulled the man close and whispered.

“Calm your breathing. Golems lack good eye-sight and hearing. If you quietly hide in the corner of the cave, then you’ll be safe. You can believe me. I’m an expert on demon characteristics.”

O-Okay. I understand.”

“Now, follow after me and breathe slowly. One. Two. Hoo.”

“Hoo…… hooo.”

“Good. That’s it. Inhale and exhale slowly.”

The adventurer settled his breathing. I grabbed his hand tightly. It was a well-known fact that people became relaxed when a professional grabbed their hand during a crisis.

“One……”

The adventurer breathed while following my command. I stealthily pulled out the dagger.

“Two……”

It was at the moment he was going to breathe out. With the blade, I slit his throat. Calm breathing could never come out of his mouth ever again. Blood filled his gullet and his breathing couldn’t become words. The only sound to come out were gurgles and coughs. Shortly after, the man met death.

At about the same time the man stopped breathing in my arms, the golem had taken care of the other remaining person.

The golem simply raised its foot and stomped the last man. The human body was a lot harder than I had expected. A man’s body wasn’t crushed immediately.

A terrible scream came from the adventurer each time the golem’s feet came down. The screams grew weaker as the stomping continued. At a certain point, the screams itself had stopped completely. Only the sound of bones breaking echoed lowly. The sticky substance attached to the golem’s foot was probably the man’s guts.

It was a gruesome conclusion.

“……Hoo.”

I sat back against the cave wall.

Exhaustion weighed down on my entire body. The heat had yet to subside. I didn’t know that warmth could be so unpleasant. On the other hand, the cold coming off the wall was good. It was the perfect temperature for me right now.

Half the temperature.

Half.

“……It’s not over yet.”

I muttered to myself.

I felt tired as if I had stayed up for four nights in a row. Regardless, I had several manuals carved into my skull. Carved like the ancient hieroglyphics in Egypt. The instincts, that was implanted into me since I was a child, whispered to me.

‘Clean up everything.’

If you don’t want your crime to be caught henceforth.

‘End what you’ve started.’

If you don’t want malice and apprehension to remain.

“……”

I calmly knitted my brows.

My pounding chest slowed down.

My breathing settled and my composure returned.

Humans were beasts of instincts.

If you create an instinct for every possible situation, then no matter when and where you are, you’ll be able to cope like a beast of prey.

There was no need for trial and error.

In that sense, my father’s words were correct.

In truth, I, ‘whose life was in danger’ responded by ‘getting rid of the humans who endangered me’ with no hesitation whatsoever. You could say it was thanks to that I could stay alive. (TL note: He means during the process of killing, not the instant before summoning the golem)

“At any rate, father is still…”

Even after death he was haunting me like a bothersome ghost.

I stood up and went through the pockets of the corpses. This was not stealing.

I’m only taking back what was mine. After going through all the inside pockets and shoes, my fortune went up to 34 gold coins.

It was enough to summon one more golem and a goblin as well.

“Map Window”

The inner map of the cave popped up in mid-air.

I wonder if it was because they were moving cautiously, but the other two groups hadn’t gotten that far ahead. I decided to go and wait at the locations that they’ll arrive at. Using a shortcut unknown to the adventurers, I got ahead of them.

♦

“Shit, why is there a monster left……!”

The second battle commenced.

The plan was very simple.

The golem was sitting in a dark corner of the tunnel. As much as its body was made of stone, in a dark tunnel, it was impossible to tell the golem apart from the other boulders. So thus, right when the adventurers were passing by, I launched a sudden attack.

The surprise attack worked nicely.

On the first hit an adventurer’s head was destroyed. Another adventurer was then grasped by the golem’s hand, it then crushed the body with ease.

It took merely 40 seconds for the unit of three to shrink down to only a single man standing.

“Keuuk!?”

I stabbed the back of the remaining adventurer who was focusing on only the golem.

This time it wasn’t a dagger but a long sword. The blade fully pierced through his chest.

“It can’t, be……”

The adventurer looked down at his chest. He had an expression on his face as if he couldn’t believe that a sword was going through his chest.

The adventurer twisted his face, bright red bloodshot eyes glared at me.

“Demon Lord, you bastard…… betrayed us……!”

“……”

I pulled the long sword out.

The man fell to the floor. I wonder if the blade had sliced his lungs. His last breath just now was wheezy. Like the sound of air leaking out of a punctured bicycle wheel. That was the man’s last scream.

“Betrayal, huh.”

You were wrong.

I never betrayed you men. On the contrary, it was the opposite. You men were the invaders and this was Dantalian’s home. If you had not charged in here, then you wouldn’t have had to die.

“Haah.”

I went through the pockets of the corpses.

Red blood was stained on the copper and silver coins. I held these coins tightly.

As long as I was trapped in the role of the Demon Lord Dantalian, other adventurer parties will come to capture me in the future. In preparation for that day, I have to collect war funds.

    Demon Lord Castle’s Wealth
    Withdrawal Amount: xx Libra
    Total Balance: 58 Libra
    ※Warning. If you withdraw too much at once, you may go bankrupt.

I deposited the money into the castle vault.

If you included the 20 Libra that I had spent on summoning the golem, then I was almost back to having the original amount I had started with. Now everything will be over once I got rid of Riff’s group. I climbed up onto the golem’s shoulder and headed towards the next stage.

In a moment, I arrived at the entrance of the castle.

I made the golem lie in wait and stood in a dignified stance at the cave entrance.

Around 20 minutes passed. From the other side of the tunnel a group emerged. It was Riff’s unit.

“Hm? If it isn’t your honorable Demon Lord.”

Riff recognized me and creased his brows.

“How come you’re by yourself? Where are the others?”

I did not answer.

I wonder if they had noticed that the atmosphere was grim. The group stopped walking on their own. Well, if you had eyes then it was normal to feel like something was off. My entire body was fatigued.

“Your honor. I asked where the others are.”

Riff asked again. Impatience started to show on his face. ‘Everyone is alright. They left to do something real quick’. He was probably hoping for this kind of response. I cut down that hope mercilessly.

“They’re dead.”

“…… eh?”

“They’re all dead. Not just the group that was with me. Excluding your group, all seven men have died. They’re probably enjoying a nice beer together in the after life.”

A voice so cold came out of my mouth that it even surprised me as well. It wasn’t simply cold, but a strong feeling of mockery was mixed in as well. You could tell by the contorting look on Riff’s face.

“Don’t tell me…… the enemy attacked on both sides?”

“Sir Riff. Please stop acting the fool when you already understood what has happened. If what you said was correct, then there’s no chance for me to be standing here like this.”

I chuckled.

“There are no invading enemy forces anywhere in the castle. That was a lie. A big fat lie.”

“What?”

“Do you still not understand? It was purely a strategy made to kill each and every one of you.”

The adventurer’s faces changed dramatically.

From welcoming to suspicion. From suspicion to rage.

But this wasn’t enough. My goal was to raise their rage into wrath. I twisted the edges of my mouth and grinned widely.

“It’s all thanks to you, Riff. I’m honestly grateful that you believed me so easily. Adventurers trusting a Demon Lord. The main character to make this unlaughable comedy a success was not me, but you.”

“It was all a trick……?”

“Yes. I killed all 7 people with these hands.”

I took out the dagger I had hidden within my clothes. You could see the blood distinctively on the blade.

“This person and that person were all nothing but fools. Each time I stabbed their necks with this dagger, they each reacted by opening their eyes wide. Did you all honestly believe that a Demon Lord like myself would obediently cooperate? That’s why beginner adventurers who lack experience are laughable.”

“……”

“The newbie’s reaction was especially amazing. He looked at me and muttered ‘It can’t be’ even though blood was pouring out of his throat. So I politely stabbed him one more time. His wife back home should be relieved. She’s better off not having such a foolish hu—”

[Adventurer Riff’s affection went down by 21.]

[Adventurer Zed’s affection went down by 23.]

[Adventurer Zack’s affection went down by 20.]

The affection of the three adventurers instantly fell to 0. And amongst those three, someone had thrown a stone at me as hard as they could. With a thuck the stone hit my forehead. The rock contained a lot of killing intent. He probably intended to finish me with that. But, unfortunately, the aim was slightly off so after scratching a bit of my forehead it had flown passed me.

“—That’s not right.”

I’m sorry to say, but that was your last chance to hit me. If you had tossed it a bit better I may have died. You may have received the happy ending of ‘the adventurers defeated the Demon Lord’. It might have been a very slim chance but that opportunity very much existed.

“Not the side of my head, but here.”

I tapped the center of my forehead with my finger.

“∎∎∎∎, ∎∎∎∎∎—!”

It was at that moment the golem attacked them from behind. The golem, that was crouched like a boulder a second ago, reached out its arms.

It was the final battle.

Please do your best to resist, Riff. You’re the first human to push my head down onto the ground in the past 10 years. I’ve been vowing to repay you back fully for what you did for quite a while now.

Dantalian’s Demon Lord Castle

Impossible. This is impossible!

What is that man? He’s giving off a completely different atmosphere compared to earlier! Where’d the man who kept lowering his head like a small fry disappear to? Who is that man over there who’s grinning so shamelessly……!?

“Kuaaaaaaah!”

Shit, another one got done in.

It was especially bad that the golem had come from behind. Before we could even react someone was already dead. We tried our best to fight with just us two but…… damn it.

The weakness of inexperienced adventurers was revealed here. The other remaining adventurer was getting too worked up so he wasn’t able to back me up properly. This half-wit. Excitement will only become poison during combat. How has he not shoved this basic information into his skull yet!

…… no. The person who brought these greenhorns to the Demon Lord’s castle was me. I was blinded by greed and ended up making a mistake. At the time I didn’t think it was wrong. I kept telling myself that it was a smart idea. In the end, did my foolishness bring upon this misfortune……?

The words the Demon Lord had said while he was being cynical was right. We were too careless. Shit. But I don’t plan to die easily, you know!

Despite everything, I’m still a professional when it comes to surviving. I’ll struggle disgracefully to the very end if I have to.

“I-I surrender!”

I tossed away my shield and sword.

The man before me uttered a “Oh?”, and raised the corners of his mouth. That smile came incredibly naturally to him. That was probably his true-self; cold-blooded, merciless, and more sinister than anyone else.

“Aren’t you being quite well-behaved, Captain Riff.”

“I will do whatever you want if you spare my life. I-I really did not know. That your honor was such a terrifying person. Please, I beg for your forgiveness.”

I did my best to display a pathetic expression.

It was obvious what was going on in your head, Demon Lord.

You had won and I had lost. The positions were suddenly switched. The Demon Lord who was pretending to be the loser until now was finally able to reverse the situation.

You’re probably thrilled and excited. It’s clear that you’ll want to enjoy this as much as you can. To take delight in your victory by humiliating me as you please.

“I was dull and foolish. I apologize, honorable Demon Lord! Please feel pity for this lowly human and grant me mercy! I will never step foot in your honor’s territory ever again……!”

I slammed my forehead against the floor repetitively.

I didn’t care if this method was loud and pathetic. It was better if it was noisy. The most important part was to satisfy the other person’s pride. Sure enough, the Demon Lord grinned.

“I see. If you wish to apologize then do so by cutting off your own hand.”

“M-My hand?”

“Yes. Do so and I will let you live. I won’t cut your arms or legs off either.”

The Demon Lord chuckled.

“Think carefully. In truth, I’m the one at a loss in this trade.”

It was the exact words that I had tossed in ridicule at the Demon Lord before. Those words came right back at me like an arrow. I grinded my teeth.

But this was a chance. I would be able to take out a weapon without having to worry about drawing suspicion.

“Of course. I will more than gladly cut my hand. Thank you for forgiving me. Thank you very much, honorable Demon Lord……”

I took out the dagger that was attached to my hip.

While lifting up the dagger in the air as if to bring it down onto my hand, I stood up just like that and charged at the Demon Lord.

You naively showed an opening, Demon Lord Dantalian!

“Haaaaaaaaaa!”

I ran while crying out. I’m sorry to say but I’m gifted at controlling people’s psychology. It’s your own fault for getting overconfident and lowering your guard just because you were so close to winning.

The Demon Lord may have been holding a long sword, but it was too late to get into a proper stance. The golem behind me probably won’t make it on time. Even if the front or the back moves, I’ll be the first to stab this blade into the damn Demon Lord!

I put more spirit into my body and thrust my dagger forward and—

My body staggered right before I could reach him.

“Uhiik!?”

I ended up letting out a questionable noise. My foot had suddenly stopped. When I looked down I saw a bluish slime wrapped around my right foot.

I was unable to withstand the momentum I was running with a second ago and fell forward. I groaned as I desperately tried to take my foot out of the slime. It wouldn’t budge.

1 second, 2 second had passed before my mind started catching up to what had happened. Since when did he prepare something like a slime? Don’t tell me, from the very beginning? Are you telling me that he knew from the start that I was pretending to surrender?

Then, something large crushed my body.

“Kuuaah!”

The golem had slammed its fist down onto my lower body. My legs were obviously destroyed and my waist along with them. I could vividly feel the sensation of my bones breaking. The intense pain made everything in front of me start to blur and fade.

Something was flowing out of me. Was it my blood? It could possibly be my innards. Whatever it was, this was my end. I had never experienced something like dying before, but for some reason I had the strong feeling of ‘I will die here’.

“Damn, it……”

I vomited blood. I couldn’t even muster the strength to talk. A blurry shadow came into my fading vision. The shadow moved, then, a blade stabbed into my throat.

To make sure that I was dead at this point.

Isn’t that a bit too much for a life that was already destined to die?

Before everything went dark I was able to see the other person’s face for just a moment. The man was looking down at me and smiling.

“—Go back to your mother’s womb and learn again, amateur.”

 

%eb%8d%98%ec%a0%84-%eb%94%94%ed%8e%9c%ec%8a%a4-volume-1-page-141

A devilish grin was there.

Is that so.

Is that what the race known as Demon Lords are.

Kuh. From the start, this was a monster that a low-class adventurer like me should have never dared to go after. It was us who were the ones being hunted, not him. I had stupidly forgotten my position on the food chain……

For an animal that was unable to recognize a predator, the only fate that laid in wait for them was death. I had vowed to never fight monsters in my life and live as a looter, but in the end I ended up facing the final of final monsters.

My vision was black. Even after death I’ll probably be severely regretting my foolishness……

Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 4, Day 4
Dantalian’s Demon Lord Castle

“Haaaa.”

Once I made sure Riff was dead I let out a long sigh.

It was over. I toppled down and sat on the floor. It felt as if my extremely sensitive nerves had been put into a spa and were starting to melt. It was the aftereffect for running my brain on full throttle for 3 hours straight.

After receiving a mysterious survey in my email I was dropped into a different world. It was a shock that I had become a Demon Lord in a world where a hero was the protagonist, but to also discover that I was the weakest Demon Lord, Dantalian. Without being able to properly figure out what was going on, I had to face a group of adventurers and was eventually able to kill them all.

This all happened in 3 hours. It was obvious that my brain would be so exhausted. Thank you for going through the effort, my pretty brain(TL note: He says this in English). You worked to the point that some brain cells most likely evaporated.

[1. Annihilate the adventurers like this.]

[2. Be taken by the adventurers like this.]

The words that were lying in the corner of my view shined brightly.

The letters broke apart into little white particles and then formed different lines.

[A cruel and merciless decision!]

[Infamy increased slightly.]

“Not a cruel decision but a wise decision.”

I blurted out in rebuttal.

Then how else was I supposed to deal with a gang of people who had invaded with the intention to kill me? Were we supposed to grab each others’ hands and sing songs about how we’re all one? What an unfunny joke.

[Tutorial Clear!]

The sound of a victory horn rang loudly.

A row of notification windows appeared in mid-air.

[You will receive a difficulty bonus.]

[LUNATIC— You will receive the highest bonus.]

[S-Grade privileges will be selectable.]

[Please select a privilege.]

[※Warning: The systems automatically presented during the tutorial will not be accessible after this point. If there is a system that you really want to keep then please select it in the privileges.]

That’s kind of you.

So it meant that things like being able to see the Demon Lord Castle’s status, seeing other people’s stats, and showing your affection rate with other people were given as a service only during the tutorial.

It was a sampler. To test out all the systems first and then later decide which one you need the most.

A list of all the privileges appeared in front of me.

    Nest Building Demon Lord(S) Observe the state of the castle and extend it.
    Zeus’s Eagle(S) No matter what terrain, be able to see a real-time map.
    Cronus’s Heritage(S) Every 10 years you are able to save your progress.
    Aphrodite’s Apostle(S) Be able to see the affection rate of other people.

    Athena’s Apostle(S) Your leadership ability goes up to Great Hero rank.
    Ares’s Apostle(S) Your might ability goes up to Great Hero rank.
    Apollon’s Apostle(S) Your intelligence ability goes up to Great Hero rank.
    Demeter’s Apostle(S) Your politics ability goes up to Great Hero rank.
    Hermes’s Apostle(S) Your charm ability goes up to Great Hero rank.
    Hephaestus’ Apostle(S) Your technique ability goes up to Great Hero rank.

    Dionysus’s Foot(S) All saintesses in every shrine worships you.
    Poseidon’s Arm(S) 50 highest-class aquatic demons obey you.
    Hera’s Ear(S) You can understand and use every demon language.
    Hade’s Eye(S) You gain an exclusive storage for your items and money.
    Prometheus’s Hand(S) You can hire and summon monsters whenever you desire.

“Wow. That sure is a lot……”

I looked through the list with bleary eyes.

The desire to fall over and take a nap weighed down on me heavily.

I originally wasn’t a sincere human. I was someone who revered being lazy. Can’t you tell by the fact that I had moved to some remote neighborhood and spent my days just playing computer games as soon as my father had passed away? I worked too much today!

“Uh, I guess… yeah. Let’s go with Aphrodite’s Apostle.”

I spoke as if I was trying to shoo away a friend who kept bothering me.

Being able to see the cave map was probably Zeus’s Eagle, being able to move money in and out of the vault whenever I wanted to was probably Hade’s Eye, and being able to freely summon monsters was probably Prometheus’s Hand. All of these were tempting.

However, the most cheat like skill amongst these was the ability to read other people’s minds and check affection rate. To be able to read minds. If you combined my acting skills and the ability to read minds, then I didn’t have to ever worry about going somewhere and starving to death.

[You have chosen a privilege.]

[Your stats will be distributed according to how you cleared the tutorial.]

Okay, okay.

Was it over now?

I was already leaning back against the golem. The golem’s body was made of stone and yet it was strangely warm. It was acceptable to use as a bed.
Mr. Golem. I’m sorry but I’ll be using your body as a bed for a bit.

“∎∎, ∎∎∎……”

The golem let out a soft grumble. I don’t know what he had said but the meaning got across. Make use of me whenever you please, should be a decent translation of what it had said.

A demon who’s gentle to their master but merciless to adventurers. How cool. I almost fell for you. The golem’s body really was warm. As if sleep would envelop me immediately……

What this place was.

Why this place had a similar universe to Dungeon Attack.

How systems that normally only appeared in games appeared here.

There was no way to answer these questions in my current situation. Regardless, I can clearly state what will happen from now on.

I plan to lay around and sleep all day.

INSERT INTO `chapter`(`book_id`,`name`,`data`,`number_of_read`,`upload_date`) VALUES(9,'chapter 5','A memory from long ago.

It was around the time I had started elementary school.

“Father. Why didn’t you marry only one girl?”

At that time I had learned that monogamy was common sense in nearly every country. Our country was the same. In other words, it meant that my growing environment being unusual was confirmed on a national level.

“Son. You probably won’t understand, but there are good women around the world, albeit rare. And even more rare than that are good men. If a good woman and a good man were to meet, then it’s inevitable that they’ll have sex.”

My father declared shamelessly.

As he always would.

“Oh? So for father, you were able to meet 5 of those so-called ‘rare good women’?”

“That’s because I did a lot of good things in my past life.”

“Maybe I should try believing in Allah next time.”

During that time, I would go to church every week and would constantly pray for lightning to strike down upon my father’s head. I’m not sure why, but my father was still fine. Perhaps it was because God was running an international business. He didn’t think the desperate plea of an 8-year-old child was important. Thus I decided to not get involved in God’s business industry.

Give and take.

There was always a background for the reason why I had become an athiest.

“My shrewd son. Keep in mind your father’s words.”

“Although I think that the reason why my personality became so rotten is 80% your fault, father. What is it?”

“If you’re lucky then you will meet good women. You’ll know they’re good just by looking at them. No matter what you do. Never. Never let those women go.”

“Couldn’t you have at least used the singular term instead of the plural, father? Thanks to that all I hear is a very trash-like statement.”

“Trash, huh…… oh well. Son. Be prepared beforehand. No matter what you choose, you will live a life more harsh than I.”

“Why would I? My personality is already more mature than you, father.”

“Because you’re more competent than I am.”

He raised the corners of his mouth.

“People who are overly competent won’t marry just anyone. In the end, they’ll search for a companion who can understand them. The only person capable of understanding a competent man is an equally competent woman. Then what will happen?”

My father raised an index finger.

“Since two competent people are together they’ll most likely achieve great things. Once you reach a higher position, you’ll end up meeting another woman as competent as you are. You’ll be able to understand one another and then it’ll become 3 people together.”

He raised his middle finger.

“Now that there’s 3 you’ll get to an even higher position. Once at the top you’ll take a look around and find another competent woman. Now there’s 4. And before you know it, it’ll increase to 5.”

He finally lifted up his ring finger and pinky.

I was dumbfounded and retorted back.

“……In my entire life, I had never heard nonsense as nonsensical as this. I thought it was impossible for pregnancy to happen between a dog and a human, but when I look at you, father, I worry that I might be the one to have gotten past that impossible barrier as a miracle and was born.”

“You are more of a Devil than I am. This dad of yours’ limit was 4 women. That’s as far as I could get. Regardless, I look forward to see how far up you’ll go.”

“Garbage of a father, I will not go out with anyone—”

I looked him straight in the eyes.

“And even if I do end up doing so, I will only date a single person. I will never do something like cheat and hurt the person that is important to me.”

“That’s not a surprise, coming from you.”

He grinned.

Annoyingly.

Even as his son, it was a cool smile.

▯Weakest Demon Lord, Rank 71st, Dantalian
Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 4, Day 18
Dantalian’s Demon Lord Castle

Life was beautiful.

To the point that the people who think themselves as nihilistic should admit as well that life was so beautiful.

Following the setting in Dungeon Attack, Demon Lords are a clump of magical energy. All bodily functions are handled by magic. In other words, if you don’t eat or sleep, thanks to the magical energy, your mind will still be fully active.

There was no problem even if I rolled around on my bed for 4 days straight.

I didn’t even have to work for food.

Isn’t this the very life that NEETs all around the world had dreamed for?

I’d like to borrow this position and make a declaration.

Demon Lords are the best.

Demon Lords, hooray.

Here’s to you, Demon Lords

“……Your highness, Dantalian.”

There was a time I had actually thought all that.

I turned my head slowly because of the abrupt voice.

I was currently lying down on my bed, so if I wanted to turn my head then I had to flip my entire body as well. It was an incredible amount of wasted energy. As if I was looking at the Minister of Environment who had just finished reading the report on electricity consumption during the summer, I looked at the person with an accursed gaze.

“Why are you calling me?”

“Today is the deadline. This time, no matter what, I will have your highness pay back the debt and interest.”

There a female, who wore her hair in two braids, stood.

She looked around the age of a girl who had just graduated high school. Not matching her outer appearance, her face was incredibly void of emotions. Like a straggler returning from war would often be like, the girl looked as if she had long ago burned off all the fuel that was in the thing called emotions.

Should I call it dryasdust?

That was this girl’s normal expression. It had been half a month since I had first met her, but I had never witnessed something even remotely close to a smile from her. I’m starting to suspect that she has some sort of illness. Perhaps forever-on-her-period syndrome. That sounded like a sickness that existed.

The girl spoke.

“The 100 Libra that your highness had borrowed three months ago. If your highness includes this months’ interest, then the interest alone is a total of 96 Libra. This one is here to receive 196 Libra from your highness.”

“I’m saying it again, but I have never borrowed money from you.”

I dug the inside of my nose with my pinky.

“How am I supposed to repay money that I had never borrowed? Give up.”

“That is wrong. Your highness has most definitely received a loan from the Keuncuska Firm. Please look at this bond of debt. Your highness’ thumbprint is certainly here.”

The girl took out a scroll parchment from her bag.

In a vintage handwriting, a contract was written on the parchment.

    IOU

    100 Libra Coins(40% interest every month)

    Rank 71st, Demon Lord Dantalian, has been loaned the above written amount of gold.
    The interest must be paid on the 10th of every month, and the principal is due by Year 1505, Month 4, Day 11th. In the case that the interest is overdue, the creditor may at anytime demand all of the principal and interest. The debtor, Demon Lord Dantalian, during that time shall not display opposition.

    Year 1505, Month 2, Day 1

    Rank 71st, Nameless Demon Lord, Dantalian
    Keuncuska Firm, Exclusive Consultant, Lapis Lazuli

    Hereby vow to Hermes and Hades.

“As you can see.”

The girl displayed to me the parchment and spoke methodically.

“The deadline date was originally the 11th of this month. A week has already passed. Your highness had requested for us to delay it for a week. Your highness. The time limit is up.

“Did I— do that—. I don’t remember—.”

“It is of no use to feign ignorance.”

I was going to pretend to be indifferent but this girl sternly cut me off.

“I can not delay the deadline any further.”

“Can you not push it back another week?”

“That is impossible.”

Immediate response.

“Didn’t your highness say the same thing last time? Delaying the deadline may be possible once, but two times in a row will not be allowed.”

A spiteful girl.

She was the type of person who could kill someone without blinking.

♦

A week ago.

This girl had suddenly visited my castle while introducing herself as an employee of some firm. These type of guests were usually unwelcomed back in my original world, and sure enough, she had abruptly pushed a debt bill on me and pressured me to pay up.

“A debt……?”

“That is correct, your highness.”

The girl lowered her head and bowed. It was like she was a veteran maid. Her every movement was well-disciplined.

Except the fact that I couldn’t even feel the least bit of respect towards me. She gave off the feeling that she had only bowed because greetings were a core part in social interactions.

Well, I was only a Demon Lord in name. I was still something that would compare to a ricefish, Dantalian. I’m grateful she displayed even the smallest bit of etiquette towards me, on the contrary, I should be the one that should be bowing. I had no complaints.
(TL note: Ricefish)

“Your highness had taken a loan of 100 Libra from our firm, Keuncuska, around this time two months ago. Since the day to pay the interest has arrived, this lowly one has come in person to meet your highness.”

“My god……”

I closed my eyes tightly.

I didn’t think that Demon Lord Dantalian’s position could get any worse than this, but it seems that I had been overly optimistic.

I had put my life on the line and was able to repel the adventurers but now a personal moneylending business had arrived at my doorsteps. Economic aggression after an armed protest. It was an actual standard colonial policy. It was admirable. If need be, I wanted to applaud this clean diplomatic method. If the person directly involved wasn’t me, that is. Fucking hell.

“Your highness?”

While I was up to my neck with despair, the girl had tilted her head. She most likely had been an acquaintance of Dantlian for quite a while now. She might notice that I was suddenly acting strange compared to before.

For now, in order to figure out the person’s name, I muttered in my head.

‘Status.’

    Name: Lapis Lazuli

    Stamina: E rank
    Power: D rank
    Defense: F rank

    Affection: 0

So her name was Lapis Lazuli.

I composed myself to have a serious expression. It would be fitting to lie from here on. Since the affection was at 0, it’d only be appropriate to speak a bit coldly to her.

“Lazuli. There’s a secret that I must tell you.”

“……”

Eh?

I don’t know why, but the girl had slightly raised her eyes. It seemed like she was surprised by what I had said. I didn’t really say anything strange yet, and yet her reaction was weird.

“What’s the matter?”

“My apologies. This one had never expected in their wildest dreams that your highness would remember this one’s name. Normally, your highness would refer to this one as crossbreed, low-life, larva, or prostitute……”

Dantalian was a piece of trash that went beyond expectation.

I cleared my throat and changed the subject.

“Ehem. Bearing that in mind, this is an issue which involves that as well. You may not know this, but exactly one week ago a group of adventurers had invaded here. While I was retaliating against said adventurers I had hit my head against the ground. Then what do you know. I found out that I had lost parts of my memory.”

 I then pointed at my leg.

“My leg was also seriously injured and had only just recently healed a couple of days ago. If things went wrong then I would have died. Honestly speaking, other than knowing that your name is Lapis Lazuli, everything else is rather fuzzy and vague.”

“…… Is that so.”

Lapis Lazuli gazed at me with eyes containing suspicion.

Of course, there was no way she would easily believe the words of a man who had suddenly claimed to have lost his memories. Nevertheless, I stayed brazen. For a moment, an atmosphere as if we were trying to analyze one another flowed.

It seemed Lapis Lazuli had understood in her own way and bowed her head once again.

“To serve your highness would be a privilege for this one. If there is anything that this one can do to help your highness, then say so and this one shall do her utmost to help.

“Good. Then I’d like to request something immediately.”

“Yes.”

“…… Could you possibly delay the deadline a bit.”

Lapis Lazuli blinked.

“Pardon?”

“I currently do not have the money on me. I will most definitely pay within this week, so please grant me a bit more time. Okay? I beg of you.”

“……”

Her gaze became cold.

Ten to one, she had most likely misunderstood and assumed that I had claimed to have lost my memories in order to delay the deadline. Sadly, I did not have the ability to fix the misunderstanding……

Lapis Lazuli was a level-headed woman.

If I was allowed to be more subjective, then she was a devilish woman. She did not consent to delaying the deadline by even a week. Despite my plea, she only gave me 2 days.

From that day on for a week, I played a game of cat and mouse with that loan shark.

On the first day.

“Your highness. The interest has already been pushed back by two months. The original loan was 100 Libra, but the interest alone is already at 96 Libra. Please make your payment.”

“In the first place, is it not ridiculous that the compound interest is 40% every month!? That’s excessively expensive!”

I exclaimed while walking down one of the cavern paths.

In one corner of the cave there was an underground lake. Interestingly, the lake was heated just like a spa. My hobby was to go there every day and spend my time peacefully enjoying the heat of the water enveloping my body. However, that moneylender had solved her lodging problem in this cave and kept bothering me. Thanks to that, I couldn’t properly enjoy my simple hobby.

“Keuncuska Firm or whatever they’re called, I’ll make a formal complaint! This kind of interest rate is both economically and logically an evil influence to this society!”

“That is why this one had warned your highness since the beginning. That, unless it was a desperate situation, to never borrow money from our Keuncuska Firm. But the one to had kept pushing for the loan two months ago was none other than your highness, Dantalian.”

“No. That wasn’t me who borrowed that money……!”

I clenched my teeth and roared.

Why did I have to pay back the money that someone else had borrowed?

It was irrational. Ah, irrational beyond measure. Life being beautiful was, as expected, a delusion. Life was dirty and cheap. I cursed at my fate of possessing a Demon Lord.

Demon Lords were the worst.

Demon Lords die.

“I apologize, but this one does not understand what your highness means.”

“I’m saying that it was some half-wit named Dantalian that had taken that loan……!”

Lapis Lazuli looked this way as if she was looking at something rotten.

Isn’t your highness that Dantalian, is what her eyes were asking me. Yes. People other than myself probably wouldn’t be able to understand what I meant. That was obvious……

“If it truly is too difficult, then there is also the option to declare bankruptcy.”

“I have to be concerned about bankruptcy right from the start, huh. Ahaha.”

Hello, people of the nation.

This is exemplary citizen turned Demon Lord.

When talking about Demon Lords, you’d think they’d command an army of demons and mercilessly devastate humans, but for some reason I seemed to have absolutely nothing.

I thought it was unfair that I had almost died to adventurers as soon as I had opened my eyes, but to now also tell me that I had to repay a debt? Where should I go to deal with this unfairness? The cops? Court? Or maybe a mental hospital?

I just wanted to comfortably live the remainder of my life as a NEET in the corner of my house. Peacefully. Without causing any fuss. Were you blocking me off from even this small desire? Was the world messing with me?
I wanted to kill myself……

“Your highness. It is not embarrassing to not have the ability to pay back the loan. However, the thing that is embarrassing is the attitude of trying not to repay the debt. What does your highness mean by having lost your highness’ memories? How could a great Demon Lord, like your highness, resort to such a childish excuse.”

“I really am going through partial memory lost!”

“…… haaa. Of course.”

“You really do have the knack of making people upset, huh!?”

The corners of my mouth twitched.

“Anyways, give me a week. Just a week. Once a week has passed I will do whatever you tell me to.”

“This one shall wait one more day.”

“So frugal……!”

Second day.

It was morning and as I was getting up from my bed, as if she had been waiting for me, Lapis Lazuli entered the room. I should add that I had the habit of sleeping naked.

Based on a logical conclusion, when Lapis Lazuli had invaded my quarters, I was sporting a new fashion style of not even wearing my underwear. Thus, as soon as I saw her I had let out a scream.

“Get out! I said get out!”

“Your highness. The interest……”

“I’m not wearing anything below right now!”

“That is fine. This one does not care for your highness’ body.”

“I care!”

With all my strength I threw a pillow at her.

Lapis Lazuli didn’t even move an inch and allowed herself to be hit. Of course, the attack didn’t work. Her face was still calm and emotionless.

“This one will say it again, but declaring bankruptcy is also a fine idea. If your highness can’t possibly pay off the debt then please do put into consideration this option.”

“…… I’ll hear you out.”

I spoke while slowly getting dressed.

I was getting a headache by this loan shark.

“What will happen if I declare bankruptcy?”

“For starters, our firm will claim all rights to the Demon Lord castle.”

They’ll seize my home.

A beautiful hell of a life was already being spread before me.

“After that, our firm will make a few requests to your highness. All your highness has to do is oblige.”

“So I’ll be downgraded to your firm’s puppet……”

“My apologies, but that is so.”

I had done this kind of work before, so I knew well about it.

Like a large company supporting a poor politician and using them as a chess-piece. In this world, it was a big firm taking advantage of a Demon Lord in poverty.

“Look around, Lazuli. I am a Demon Lord with nothing.”

I told her earnestly.

“It wouldn’t even be fun to use me as a puppet.”

“That is alright. There’s an infinite amount of economical uses by just being a Demon Lord. Our firm executives are putting a lot of expectations on your highness, Dantalian.”

“You really are quite honest!”

“Unfortunately, the only product that your highness can purchase from this one is honesty.”

But you don’t have anything so you can’t buy anything, anyway.

Was the nuance that she had plainly put into her words.

I disliked her.

I really disliked her.

I disliked her to the point that I wanted to step on her foot.

“……your highness?”

“What is it?”

“Your highness is right now stepping on this one’s left foot.”

“I consider it a boast that my thoughts and actions line up.”

“It hurts.”

“You don’t look like you’re in pain.”

“I’m sorry…… but I actually feel more pleasure from it.”

“Were you perhaps a pervert!?”

“Despite this one’s looks, there is succubus mixed into this one’s blood.”

“Was it not you who stated that all succubus being perverts was just a bias last time we met! You yourself said it!”

“Please throw away the bias that all biases are nothing but bias.”

“Why are you the one acting high and mighty……!”

“I’m sorry, but I’m actually a very competent person.”
(TL note: She stops using ‘this one’ here.)

“Annoying! You’re seriously annoying!”

“I am a half-breed of a human and a succubus. My birth is so low that I am considered an outcast. Born an orphan, I roamed the bottom of the streets for 20 years. However, I was able to succeed in life with my ability alone. Now I am currently a white-collar worker for the biggest firm in the demon continent, Keuncuska. Adding to that, I am now here with your highness Dantalian as your exclusive consultant.”

“You really are competent……!?”

“That is correct. It is on a completely different level to your highness who was born a Demon Lord. But also, your highness is a Demon Lord and is yet to have achieved anything, but this one was able to climb up this far by her power alone.”

“You’re competent but as expected you’re annoying as well! What’s with that.”

“My apologies. Since this one is always honest to your highness.”

“If that’s honesty, then the world is better off if everyone was a liar.”

I wonder why.

This person wasn’t insulting me but Dantalian, but for some reason I feel offended. The girl shooting spiteful remarks at me with no emotions stabbed into my chest.

“I will make myself clear now. I do not plan to become someone’s puppet.”

“Understood.”

Lapis Lazuli nodded.

“Then please pay the debt.”

“Sorry, but I don’t have money either. Tsk tsk, it’s quite the shame. I want to give you the money but it seems my pockets are empty so I can’t! Haha! Ahahaha!”

“……”

In truth, there was 80 Libra hidden under my bed in the Demon Lord’s Quarter.

That was the money that I had risked my life to take back from the adventurers. Like I’d give the money to some frugal forever-on-her-period succubus.

“Your highness. Do you truly have the will to pay back the debt?”

“Indeed. I’m a man who’s constantly burning with will. Aah, what a tragedy. I sincerely want to give you the money, but alas, since I am penniless I am unable to do anything. Restrictions. These restrictions.”

“Then work to pay it off.”

“……Eh?”

Lapis Lazuli’s right hand glowed brightly.

A light pink magic circle formed for a moment before shortly after Lapis Lazuli was holding a pickaxe in her hand.

A pickaxe.

It was something you’d see a rough worker using in a mine.

“……Why are you giving this to me?”

“Does your highness not know? Compared to other areas, Demon Lord castles have a high concentration of magical energy. Perfectly, your highness’ castle is in the form of a cave, so if your highness picks any deposit and mines from it, then your highness should immediately get magic stones. Magic stones with a large amount of magical energy in them can sell for a very high price.”

“Are you perhaps telling me to become a miner and work?”

“Yes.”

“Are you serious.”

I unintentionally spoke with honorifics.

It was such a shock that I had forgotten for a moment that I was a Demon Lord.

“Did your highness not say that you were overflowing with will?”

Lapis Lazuli handed the pickaxe to me.

I stared blankly at the wooden stick with another iron stick attached to it.

“Now all your highness has to do is emit that will.”

“……”

CLANG!

[You have extracted 1x Iron Ore.]

CLANG!

[You have extracted 1x Iron Ore.]

CLAANG!

[You have extracted 1x Iron Ore.]

CLANG……

[You have extracted 1x Iron Ore.]

CLAAANG………

And thus, on the third day.

I glared at Lapis Lazuli ferociously.

“—I declare bankruptcy.”

“But only one day has passed.”

“It was a miracle that I was able to last 30 minutes of manual labor!”

I tossed the pickaxe as far as I could.

My body was screaming because of my sore muscles. As a person who was aiming to become a peerless house corner dwelling NEET, a large amount of labor was too tough for me. There was also no profit. Even if I swung the pickaxe all day, the most money I could earn was merely a single silver coin.

“How could I continue to do something like this!”

“It was just that your highness was boasting so much that this one had high expectations.”

“Isn’t the efficiency the worst!? The efficiency! If I made 1 silver every day, then even if I worked for one whole month, all I’d make is 6 gold! The interest alone is about to be 80 Libra this month and that’s 10 times the amount I’d make. How do you expect me to waste my time mining!” (TL note: 5 silver = 1 gold, A gold coin is referred to as a Libra. Silver is just silver)

“……”

Lapis Lazuli had abruptly stopped talking.

Her blue pupils had grown slightly bigger. For some reason, I think she was surprised at me. It was incredibly rare for Lapis Lazuli to show an emotion.

That was strange.

Nothing that I had said just now was weird. From what I could tell, a reason to be surprised didn’t exist either. I wonder why Lapis Lazuli, whose default was always void of emotions, was surprised.

“Why are you looking at me like that?”

“…… I’m sorry. This one did not expect that your highness would possibly be able to do simple mathematics. It was so unexpected that this one had become speechless.”

It was an outrageous response that went beyond my imagination!

“Your highness’ deduction is correct. It would be difficult to repay the debt with just mining.”

“Yes. If it was you then I did not doubt that you would agre…… wait. If you knew that it would be difficult to repay the debt with that then why did you make me go mining in the first place?”

“This one does not understand what your highness’ is talking about. How could someone as lowly as myself possibly make a Demon Lord do something. All this one has done was gift a pickaxe to your highness.

“Oi, this bitch……?”

I looked at Lapis Lazuli with slanted eyes.

“Lazuli. This is the first time I’ve met a woman like yourself.”

“I do not deserve such high praise.”

“I’m not joking.”

A life over 20 years.

The only woman to have messed with me excluding my mother, was my second half little sister. Putting being a half-breed and an outcast aside, it was amazing that Lapis Lazuli had still not fallen.

For example.

I was purposely treating Lapis Lazuli with affection. My goal was affection points. A Demon Lord like myself was treating a low status person like her equally. I had judged that this by itself would be enough to raise her affection considerably.

However, the results was a failure.

If I talked to her slyly, then she’d match me and responded slyly. If I tossed a joke at her, then she’d, with her emotionless face, would respond with a joke.

That was it.

She gave off the feeling that ‘since a Demon Lord like myself wanted this kind of chatter, then it was only appropriate to humor me’. As a result, she didn’t open herself up to me.

Like the need to greet in social interactions.
Lapis Lazuli treated me with only a dry and businesslike attitude.

…… and so, time passed helplessly.

INSERT INTO `chapter`(`book_id`,`name`,`data`,`number_of_read`,`upload_date`) VALUES(9,'chapter 6','Finally, today was the 7th day.

In order to see the results of my week worth of hard work, I looked straight at Lapis Lazuli and muttered in my head.

‘Status’

Soon after, the other person’s stats appeared in mid-air.

    Name: Lapis Lazuli

    Stamina: E rank
    Power: D rank
    Defense: F rank

    Affection: 2

“Haa……”

A sigh came out on its own.

After defeating the party of adventurers I had lost access to all the systems.

I couldn’t see the status of the castle, I couldn’t see the map of the area, and I didn’t have the ability to withdraw and deposit my money as I pleased anymore. Except one thing, I still had access to the function to see the stats and affection of other people.

I could know if the other person truly had an interest towards me…… This was a precious skill. Especially for a person like me whose everything relied on acting and politics.

Lapis Lazuli’s affection was only 2.

If I did not have this ability, then I would have most likely assumed that ‘I’ve gotten on friendly terms with Lapis Lazuli now’. I wouldn’t have been able to figure out what emotions lurked underneath that stoic face of hers.

But I was certain now.

This person had a frozen heart.

I was nothing more than an object of business to this succubus girl. The fact that the affection had barely gone up during this entire week proved that. She was a formidable girl.

To get close to her and then use her…… that original plan of mine was disposed of. It failed magnificently.

Regardless, it didn’t mean that all my methods had vanished.

There was a method of handling people who moved with their heads instead of their hearts. I knew exactly what that was.

Except, it was one of the more drastic out of other drastic measures.

If you wanted to hunt a tiger then you had to take up the gun yourself and dive into the mountain. At worst, I had to be prepared to be torn apart by savage beasts. That mental attitude wasn’t something you could simply order at a fast food restaurant and get moments later.

My own resolution.

If I don’t kill them then I’ll be the one to be killed, this kind of thinking was vital.

“Your highness.”

Lapis Lazuli informed me calmly.

“If your highness does not repay the debt and interest or declare bankruptcy, then the Keuncuska firm will have no other choice but to take your highness’ property and body by force.”

“I am a Demon Lord. A person with one of the highest nobility amongst demons. Who could possibly forcefully capture this Demon Lord?

“The Keuncuska Firm has a countless number of supporters. Amongst them, there are other Demon Lords like your highness. Rank 5th Demon Lord Marbas and Rank 9th Demon Lord Paimon are also included.”

The highest of Demon Lords.

They were people that a rank 71st like me couldn’t possibly face.

“Our firm is famous for being merciless to debtors who fail to make their payments. In the past, there was an incident where Rank 25th Demon Lord Glasyalabolas received a loan of 20,000 Libra and did not pay back the interest for 2 years. At that time, our firm had hired a small number of 9,000 mercenaries and left them in the command of Rank 12th Demon Lord Sitri. Your highness. Demon Lord Glasyalabolas could not even hold out for 3 weeks before surrendering.”

Lapis Lazuli let out a sigh.

“…… That is the Keuncuska Firm’s strength. It is rational violence. That is also the reason why our firm has been able to stay as the highest amongst demons for the past 500 years. Your highness Dantalian, this one is sincerely suggesting this. Please, declare bankruptcy a day sooner.”

I pushed down the sheets of my bed.

“……”

It was fine.

I could still win.

If things goes as planned, then I could rip this girl in front of me apart and make her mine.

I firmed my resolve and—

slowly, opened my mouth.

“Lazuli. I will give you a proposal that will most definitely benefit you.”

“Yes, your highness. Please tell this one anything.”

“Seeing as it has already come to this, I shall borrow more money from that firm of yours.”

Lapis Lazuli narrowed her brows.

Even if she were to hear that the world was going to be destroyed, she would probably respond to that by saying, ‘Let it be destroyed in a single moment’. For that Lapis Lazuli to narrow her brows was a huge gesture.

“This one objects.”

Her voice became a level drier.

“Your highness Dantalian already has a debt. But it is still okay. If your highness works hard for a while then your highness could more than likely pay it all off. However, if your highness receives more of a loan here……”

“Then I’ll fall further into a swamp pit.”

I smiled.

“That’s what I want.”

“Pardon?”

“Lapis Lazuli. Let us not be prudish and speak honestly.”

I held a soft smile on my lips.

“Even if you claim to be my exclusive consultant, you are still a pawn for the Keuncuska Firm. Profit for your firm will, in the end, become profit for you as well.”

According to her, Demon Lords had more than enough political uses.

To succeed in turning that figure into a puppet for the firm, Lapis Lazuli will most likely receive high praise from the executives. She will advance up faster than anyone else. To take a step, no, 20 steps, ahead of other competition.

“……”

The mixed blood succubus still had a poker face.

Was she perhaps pretending to not know what I was talking about.

“Wouldn’t myself not being able to pay the debt off be a profit to you?”

“That is a misunderstanding. This one has always, for your highness……”

“I know full well of the habits of a merchant.”

If the other person tried to make an excuse then shift the topic.

We were not fighting with weapons, but with our words. I had to attack fiercely. There was no need to listen to the other person’s useless excuses.

“Since olden times, merchants did not invest into things that wouldn’t give them profit. However, for some reason, the Keuncuska Firm had loaned me 100 Libra…”

The fact that Dantalian was incompetent was already obvious to the world.

Even if they loaned him money, there was a zero to none chance of getting anything back. It didn’t make sense. It was like a bank giving millions of won to a credit defaulter.

This meant that they didn’t plan to collect the money in the first place.

“To put a dog collar on me.”

I grinned.

“To turn me into a puppet with the debt as a pretext. From the beginning, this was your firm’s goal. Am I wrong?”

“……”

“You said it before. That if it was too difficult then that I had ‘the option’ to declare bankruptcy. But in your mind, you honestly wanted to say this.”

That bankruptcy was my only option.

A choice never existed from the get go.

The loan itself was a trap, and two months ago, the Demon Lord Dantalian got caught in it stupidly.

Now, deadpan succubus. Go on and respond.

You’re like a mountain fortress. Since it was built on top of a rugged mountain, it was a wall that was difficult to conquer. It was something annoying for invaders to even approach.

Regardless, if the fortress was sieged then it was over. I will not give you a path to escape. I’ll capture your fortress in an instant……
▯Keuncuska Merchant, Mixed Blood, Lapis Lazuli
Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 4, Day 18
Keuncuska Firm Office

Demon Lord Dantalian was smiling before my eyes.

…… Honestly confessing, I underestimated him.

It had been 1 year since I had become Demon Lord Dantalian’s exclusive consultant.

I had thought he was a good for nothing piece of trash, but it seems I was mistaken. Truthfully, I was surprised. The intimidating sharp look in his eyes and his gaze looking this way as if he was testing me.

His pupils were as dark as a well.

I couldn’t see the bottom…… that was the natural feeling I got. Was Dantalian always this kind of character?
Someone who got lucky and was born as a Demon Lord and thus lived a lazy and sleazy life. At most, that was all I thought he was……

‘Ah’

For the first time, I realized my mistake.

Because of the unexpected blow I had taken, I had unintentionally stopped talking.

To make such a mistake. To be silent here meant that I was admitting that he was correct. I had to change the topic.

“Let us assume that what your highness has inferred is correct.”

“I do not want to know about hypotheses. What I want to know is the simple truth.”

…… Are you not even giving me a corner to escape to.

The back of my neck felt cold.

Demon Lord Dantalian had most certainly changed.

Half a month ago, Dantalian was being threatened by a group of adventurers. Conveniently, it was a group of adventurers with a map of the Demon Lord castle. They may have been a group of adventurers on the same level as a small vigilante group in some far off mountain valley, but Demon Lord Dantalian was in a serious situation…… was that it? Does experiencing near death really change people so drastically?

Dantalian was a Demon Lord that I was in charge of. If that person was to become competent then unmistakably it was a situation that I should be welcoming with open arms. But honestly, it was hard to be happy.

I wanted a Demon Lord on the level of a fox. I did not want a Demon Lord on the level of a tiger. It would be troubling if the puppet was to become too clever. Who could have expected for this to happen.

The Demon Lord gazed at me hard.

“Lala. Go to the Keuncuska Firm and tell them.”

Lala?

I blinked.

“Lapis Lazuli shortened to Lala. It’s a suitable nickname.”

“……Is your highness giving a lowly one such as myself a nickname?”

“Do you not like it?”

“This one is only grateful.”

The demon world was strictly a hierarchical society.

Even if the race was the same, if the tribes were different then your status was different as well. If there were some orcs that were considered to be nobles, then there were also  orcs that were treated as slaves. If one were to try and figure out each and every of the ranks that existed then they’d have to go through hundreds, if not thousands of tribes and races.

I was an outcast. A half-breed of a succubus and a human. Succubus already received scorn as being a race of prostitutes. But amongst those, the person to be born between one and a vulgar human, was none other than myself…… Thus I was a crossbreed.

A leprosy of society.

I could not dare to come in contact with other people with this filthy body. By chance, if I were to even touch a person of a higher status than myself then I would have to cut off a finger, if I were to enter a temple then my toes would be severed, and if I were to even recite a scripture from one of the Gods then my tongue would be sliced.

That was why, when Demon Lord Dantalian had stepped on my foot I became nervous. Thankfully, it was shrugged off as a joke, but if someone else had seen this then my foot would have had to been cut off. Now looking back at it, that was most likely Dantalian’s way of threatening me.

As expected, I had to go along with the Demon Lord’s rhythm here.

I shall lower my head at once.

“What is the message that this one should deliver to the firm?”

“Demon Lord Dantalian has finally gone mad. Because he did not have anyone else to rely on he had entrusted his mind and body to you, a succubus. You, making full use of your charm, was able to successfully entice the Demon Lord.”

“……”

What were his intentions.

I couldn’t grasp what was going on in his head. However, even if I honestly spoke my mind about how foolish of an idea that was, I’d probably be pushed back in the battle of vigor. For now, I will respond as if I understood completely and as if that sounded like an interesting idea. There were times where an empty boast was a valid tactic.

“So. A mere peasant such as this one will become your highness’ concubine……? That is an interesting story.”

“Since long ago, there was nothing more romantic than the story of a prince falling in love with a peasant. It is a story that goes over big regardless of what time period it is told in. Tell your firm executives that I am so head over heels for you that it seems like I won’t be able to get out.”

“That is quite the part being given to this one. That is more than this one deserves.”

“Aah. Dantalian, doing whatever he can for money, started to spout nonsense. He claims that a disease will spread within two months, and that he knows what the cure for that disease is. That he’ll monopolize the ingredients to the cure before the plague spreads and he’ll be able to gain a fortune. Tell the firm that I wish to gain another loan with that statement.”

“……”

I see.

I was able to understand just barely.

Right now, Dantalian was setting himself up to be a clown. A Demon Lord who fell for a mere succubus. Adding to that, in order to gain another loan he made up a ridiculous lie……

“The loan amount then, huh. About 10,000 gold coins should suffice.”

“To say 10,000 gold coins……”

It was an amount that couldn’t be paid off even if he worked for 130 years.

If you included the interest, then it was an even more distant sum.

The firm executives would probably welcome it with open arms.

That was obvious. The larger the debt, then the stronger the collar on Dantalian’s neck would become. It was like a Demon Lord making a mad dash straight into a trap to self-destruct.

I’d be the very person to have lured the Demon Lord to his own destruction in this comedy, thus gaining an incredible amount of merits. No matter how low my status was, people could not ignore my contribution. At once, I’d become a candidate to become an executive for the firm.

“How about it? Does this much attract your interest?”

“Yes.”

A sweet offer.

No matter how you looked at it, it was an opportunity to gain an enormous amount of profit.

…… It was so tempting that I felt more suspicion from it.

Where would Dantalian get any benefit from this? This was a story only good for me. I didn’t expect him to give me a proper response, but I should ask him for now.

“Your highness. This one does not understand. Where does your highness plan to gain profit from this grand play?”

“You are a merchant.”

His highness Dantalian responded calmly.

“Merchants thoroughly check if there’s profit to be gained and if there is, then they’ll dash for it. If you see profit in my offer, then shouldn’t you be taking it with no questions asked?”

“Your highness is correct. However, to be cautious in front of game that appears excessively appetizing, is also a proper merchant’s attitude. If this one had woken up one morning and was told that a fox was sprawled out at the front door, then that would be hard to believe.”

Upon saying that, his highness grinned.

“Why not? The fox could have fallen for you at first sight.”

“……”

He was smooth.

His talking ability wasn’t on an average level.

Even if he had been at death’s doors before, was it possible for a person to change this much? It was strange. From a common sense point of view, this was incomprehensible.

“Lala. When a hunter is catching a fox, there are no cases where the hunter shows consideration for the fox’s feelings. That would be laughable. As a hunter, what you have to do is simple. First, take out a crossbow—”

His highness Dantalian moved his hands.

As if there really was a crossbow there.

“Go after the fox with the resolve to kill. If you fumble the shot then you will only startle it and cause it to flee. Aim exactly at the center of their forehead. And then……”

The invisible bolt on the crossbow was aimed at my forehead.

His highness Dantalian pulled the trigger.

“Bang.”

Playfully, he fired.

“Splendidly finish it off in one hit.”

“……”

“Go to the firm right away and tell them. That Dantalian has finally gone insane. That it’s the golden opportunity to forever bind that pathetic Demon Lord.”

His highness Dantalian lightly patted my shoulder.

A corner of my mind felt uneasy. On one hand, my rationality was saying that his highness was correct, but on the other hand, my heart was throwing up red flags.

This was a trap.

A cruel snare was placed before me.

If I put my foot forward thoughtlessly then it could be my end.

……Whenever my mind and heart reacted separately I would always follow the former. The problem was this situation, my heart was pounding at an unprecedented speed.

Pushing down the ominous foreboding feeling.

I moved my lips.

“Your highness. This one only fears this one situation. Namely, the game that this one had thought to be a fox had turned out to be a tiger. One arrow is not enough to catch a tiger.”

“Well. Then I guess you can only get eaten by the tiger at that point.”

His highness Dantalian put out his right hand.

Not understanding what that hand gesture meant, I stared blankly.

His highness, thinking it was helpless, smiled wryly.

“How long do you plan to leave my hand by itself like this?”

“……”

At last, I realized that his highness was requesting for a handshake.

To ask for a handshake. I did not know how to respond.

I had never held someone’s hand before up until now. The fact that our feet had touched was still excusable, but if our hands were to touch then that would be a clear crime.

“……A person of obscure birth such as this one could not dare dirty the hands of your highness.”

His highness Dantalian most likely knew this as well.

He was a person who had held a peerless amount of pride when it involved aristocratism, after all. He didn’t even consider something like myself as a person. I didn’t hold a personal grudge because of that. It would be stranger for a Demon Lord to not treat a succubus/human mixed blood like so.

I did not have a desire to sever my wrists.

“Pardon this one’s opinion, but while this one is grateful, this one would only trouble your highness’ dignity. Please withdraw your highness’ hand.”

“What a strange place to be worried about losing face while discussing such a daring topic.”

His highness Dantalian chuckled.

“If you shake my hand then would my hand suddenly become defiled, make me catch a cold, and cause my social status to drop? I merely wish to shake hands with the meaning of treating each other well from this point on.”

“Even if your highness were to now have a negative opinion of the hierarchical system, the majority of the people do not share that opinion. If a peasant such as this one were to come in contact with your highness’ body then upon this one a legal punishment will……”

“Ooh. So are those ‘majority’ here?”

With exaggerated movements, his highness Dantalian takes a look around. Naturally, there were only his highness and myself, the two of us here.

“Demon Lord Dantalian is also a trash like person anyways. I am only a Demon Lord by name. I do not have anything at all. Lala. Do you still wish not to shake my hand?”

“……”

Having said that much, I did not have the right to refuse.

Carefully, I reached out and touched his hand.

The first person’s hand that I had ever touched was cold. I furtively felt the touch of his palm. Upon doing so, his highness Dantalian grasped my hand tightly.

“Treat me well from now on.”

“…… Yes. Please treat this one well as well, your highness.”

It felt like it would be a long relationship.

I wasn’t sure why, but my intuition told me so.

▯Keuncuska Executive, Miser Goblin, Torukel
Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 4, Day 20
Keuncuska Firm Headquarters, Conference Room

“For there to be a full assembly. Quite the rare occasion, keruk.” (TL note: That’s the sound he’s making ‘keruk’. It has no meaning.)

An order had suddenly come from the firm headquarters for a full assembly.

Keuncuska executives were dispatched across the continent. I too had plans to go to Bataafse today to direct a fleet. This full assembly was clearly not scheduled.

To suddenly call for all the executives to gather…… it wasn’t an everyday occurrence. I had a bad feeling. Did something big happen somewhere, perhaps.

Concealing my anxious mind, I made my way to the headquarters. In a large meeting room all of the executives were gathered.

“Keruruk.”

Still as usual, there were a bunch of rough mugs. Vampires, werewolves, lizardmen. It was quite the exhibition of races. ……Hm? In one corner of the conference room there was a girl that I had never seen before. Her hair was a light pink. Races with that hair color were rare.

It was then that I had made eye contact with that girl.

“Hm……!”

Unintentionally, I gulped.

The venomous eyes on her emotionless face were out of the ordinary. Those were eyes of a person who had killed before. And not only one or two people, but eyes that had killed a countless number of times. Thankfully, the time we exchanged glances was short. The girl had shortly after turned her head.

Keruk.

I didn’t know who she was, but this emergency assembly was probably called for because of her. Situations always precipitate because of unwelcomed guests. There was a girl I had never seen before here. I could easily analogize.

The executives were voicing their discontent.

“Now that Miser Torukel is also here, start the conference already.”

“Do you know how many pushed customers there are?”

“Yeah, that’s right. It’ll be bad if I can’t sell all of the dried herrings today.”

What impatient people.

Even I had plans to hold an audience with the merchants of Phrygia at the harbor. I had a fairly busy body. Time is essential for a merchant. Be it a meeting or whatever, start already. And if possible, end it soon.

“Well. Everyone calm down.”

The old vampire sitting in the upper seat calmed the executives.

“There is a reason why we have called for all of the executives to gather. We will not waste your time so do not worry.”

Ivar Lodbrok.

That old man with the splendidly grown white beard was our firm’s highest executive. He could be referred to as the actual person who was controlling the entire firm.

Fitting for a person known as vampire, he had lived for over 600 years. Although, I do have to say that he should crawl into his coffin and have his funeral carried out already. He sure does live for a long time.

“Now then, Lapis Lazuli. Explain.”

“Yes, chief.”

The girl responded at the center of the conference room.

Lapis Lazuli? ……  I had heard of that name before.

“It’s the fellow born with the cursed bloodline.”

“Why is something like that attending this executive conference?”

Several of the executives had recognized the identity of the girl. While creasing their brows they started to whisper among one another. They were openly displaying their discomfort.

Aah. I remembered. It was the kid who, despite being an outcast, was able to successfully settle into our firm.

There was a time that a topic of a girl who had talent that surpassed her status was going around. Keruruk, so that girl was the main charater of that dispute.

Certainly, her voice was clear. She was calm even though she was standing before this galaxy-like group of executives. It wasn’t normal courage, that was for certain.

“Chief, that isn’t even an executive candidate. Is that not just an office clerk? What is this? There are limits to exceptions.”

“It is already unpleasant that I have to breathe the same air as a crossbreed.”

The executives poured out their complaints.

How idiotic.

The hierarchical system was nothing more than a useless antique. It was a tool that stupid nobles used to raise their even dumber sons and daughters. Despite that, do you scorn this outcast. In the first place, us merchants already had low ranks. Tsk tsk, they were cutting off their nose to spite their face. (TL note: An expression used to describe a needlessly self-destructive over-reaction to a problem)

Ivar Lodbrok smiled bitterly.

“How about listening to what she has to say first. It is something profitable. Gold that’s been in a pig’s stomach and gold that has been dipped in holy water, they all have the same value…… Lapis Lazuli.”

“Yes. Demon Lord Dantalian has requested for a loan.”

Lapis Lazuli spoke calmly.

“Currently, Demon Lord Dantalian has a debt of 196 Libra. Even if he has to raise his debt further, he is planning to obtain a come from behind victory.”

“Hm.”

The executives turned to look at each other.

Regardless to their previous attitude, these people still had a good head on their shoulders. They quickly realized that this was a heavy agenda. Putting behind Lapis Lazuli’s status for now, the executives started to mutter amongst one another.

“Is he planning to use debt to stop debt.”

“That’s the height of stupidity right there.”

“The bunny is offering to get itself caught in the trap, there’s no reason to decline.”

“So? How much does he want to borrow?”

My thoughts were the same.

Demon Lords had a political use, even if he was a rank 71st Demon Lord. It’d be good to use this chance to tie him up.

However, after the following response, all of the executives went silent.

“The amount that Demon Lord Dantalian has requested is— 10,000 gold coins.”

What?

The expression of the executives was dumbstruck.

“Is he sane!”

“Ha, for a bumpkin who couldn’t even handle 100 gold coins.”

He was crazy, that’s insane. Those kind of words flew out openly. Despite the fact that we were badmouthing a Demon Lord, who were at the peak of social status, it was fine. There was no one other than us to hear it.

“Are you certain. 10,000 gold coins. Was that what he said exactly?”

“Swearing on the River of Styx, I am certain.”

“He really has gone mad……”

The executives smirked.

10,000 gold coins was about the amount an Earl would earn annually if the population in his territory reached 50,000. Last year, the budget processed by the Imperials from the Habsburg Empire was about 500,000 Libra.

For Demon Lord Dantalian, who didn’t have either territory or citizens, to request for 1/50 the amount earned by a great empire in a year? Did he have a slime in his skull instead of a brain?

“My dear Keuncuska comrades.”

He had probably judged that the atmosphere was getting complex. Ivar Lodbrok opened his mouth.

The meeting room slowly became quiet. If that old vampire spoke, then even the most proudest of executives closed their mouths.

“I personally think that this is a good opportunity. Certainly 10,000 gold coins is a fortune. However, if it means to make a Demon Lord forever be our housekeeping pet, then it is not that much of a precious amount.”

“Keruruk.”

I carelessly let out a laugh.

Sacred and inviolable representatives that symbolizes absolute dignity, one of the 72 lords that commands an army of demons. To have referred to such nobility as a housekeeping pet…… Indeed he was one of the three ancient vampires to still remain in this world. It was a haughty attitude fitting of Ivar Lodbrok.

Well, I’d feel sorry for leaving this entire meeting to only Ivar Lodbrok. Let’s step forward a bit here.

“Wait, chief. I have something that I wish to ask on my side.”

“Mm. Do not mince your words and speak your thoughts.”

Ivar Lodbrok met my eyes.

Pure red pupils. It was a color that reminded people of blood. There were some executives that’d whisper to one other that those eyes were frightening, however, for some reason, I could only think of those eyes as beautiful. Cold-hearted, harsh, and a cynical vampire…… Ivar Lodbrok will most definitely establish this firm into an imperishable company. If possible, I want to be there when that happens. That was my small dream.

“Could it not be a trap?”

“A trap?”

“Not one or two gold coins, but no less than 10,000 gold coins. Keruk. If Demon Lord Dantalian truly wasn’t insane, then he would have a plan.”

I did not think that Demon Lord Dantalian could possibly possess the ability to handle this huge loan. Regardless, one must consider every possibility in the world. This had to be made clear.

“That is a fairly good point.”

Hm?

Ivar Lodbrok was smiling faintly. It was an expression he’d show when he was thinking of a wicked plan. Even if he was as old as old can be, that man had cool wrinkles.

“Lapis Lazuli shall explain that part.”

“Yes, chief. I’d like to inform the pillars of Keuncuska. Currently, Demon Lord Dantalian is regarding myself as his concubine.”

“……What did you say?”

“This may be rude to say, but on my own decision, I had used my charms to entice the Demon Lord Dantalian.”

This time, the executives could not hold back their astonishment.

On the other hand, Lapis Lazuli—from start to finish maintained her emotionless face. Always calm.

No, I didn’t know whether to call that calm. Any sign of tension on her face was completely missing. For a normal office worker to not even twitch a brow when in front of all these executives? Calm or not, that was clearly strange……

“Lapis Lazuli. What do you mean by charm?”

I spoke with a sour tone.

“Are you saying that you captured the Demon Lord by using your body?”

“Just as you say, sir Torukel.”

Lapis Lazuli looked straight this way.

Solid pupils as blue as azure.

Her transparent gaze did not even budge.

“I had relations with Demon Lord Dantalian.”

“My god.”

A few executives murmured to themselves.

If one were to fornicate with a mixed blood crossbreed, a curse from God will fall upon you. It may have just been a superstition but when 90% of the population on this continent believed it seriously, you could not brush it off. For a sacred and inviolable Demon Lord to be defiled by a crossbreed. That itself was the obstinate problem. This would cause a tremendous issue to occur.

“Do you understand what you have done!”

“We could be excommunicated by the temple!”

The executives were thrusting their fingers at Lapis Lazuli’s face.

If you wanted to sell and buy products in this continent, then you had to have received a permit from the temple. Also, excluding the temple of Aphrodite and Artemis, all other temples strictly forbid outcasts from having intercourse with people of different social status……

The executives, with red faces, shouted.

“Chief! Kick that whore out right this instant!”

“Not only did she go against the laws from the Gods, but she has also put our firm in danger! We shouldn’t have let that accursed being into our firm in the first place!”

“This leprosy-like scum……!”

Criticism took the conference room by storm.

The prostitutes of the demon world, succubus.

And amongst those, the especially disgusting crossbreed.

Even I, who disliked the hierarchical system, was speechless. However, Ivar Lodbrok was calmly sitting in his seat and watching the succubus.

“That is not all. There is still one part that must be explained to the executives. What are you doing? Hurry up and tell them.”

There was a mischievous laugh mixed in Ivar Lodbrok’s voice…… he was enjoying this? Even though, adding a bit of exaggeration, the life and death of our company was on the line? In any case, vampires were not sane. Their heads were weird since they didn’t receive any sunlight. Lack of nutrition gives a serious blow to your mind. As a goblin with both refinement and common knowledge, I couldn’t keep up with him.

“Yes. There is something that I have still not told all of the executives.”

Lapis Lazuli continued to speak in a low tone.

She had received all kinds of curses and swears a second ago. Are you telling me she was still unfazed? She really was not normal.

“As you all may know, originally our firm did not deal with Demon Lords below the rank of 60 as customers. Since it meant that the class of our firm would go down. Regardless, I have been working as Demon Lord Dantalian’s exclusive consultant for the past year now. There was only one reason for this.”

After taking one breath, Lapis Lazuli announced.

“I, personally, had strongly requested for that consultant position.”

“What?”

“From the beginning I had been aiming for the position of Demon Lord Dantalian’s mistress.”

The executives started to get noisy.

The people who were criticising the succubus a second ago were now baffled. It was because Lapis Lazuli had spoken in such a dignified fashion. The situation was going further away from the area in which the executives could understand.

At that moment, someone laughed.

Turning my head, Ivar Lodbrok was laughing loudly. To be laughing in this kind of situation. Ignoring the fact that the executives were all dumbfounded, Ivar Lodbrok let out a roar.

“Comrades. Do you still not understand? Demon Lord Dantalian did not suddenly go insane. Everything was done by that succubus. In no more than a year, that kid was able to turn Demon Lord Dantalian into a slave of passion.”

So was that it. That’s what it was!

At last, everything made sense.

Although Lapis Lazuli’s status was low, she had quite the remarkable appearance. She had captivated the Demon Lord with her looks. And, unknown to us on how, she was able to incite the Demon Lord into borrowing a large fortune from the firm……

The other executives must have also realized the true nature of the situation. Their faces were becoming pale. They weren’t giving Lapis Lazuli looks of contempt anymore.

“But…… why such a reckless act……?”

“To succeed.”

“Succeed?”

“The Demon Lord will become the firm’s informant. My contribution on this matter will most likely receive high praise.”

“……”

Everyone. All of the members in the meeting room were at a lost for words.

What were they supposed to say to the office worker who had just confessed with an emotionless face that ‘I had sold my body in order to succeed’.

Ivar Lodbrok, alone, has been laughing since before.

“How is it, comrades. Is this not a masterpiece!”

“…… a masterpiece?”

I ended up asking back.

Ivar Lodbrok stood from his seat. He had spread his arms out wide as if he were showcasing something. It was like he was introducing the next actor to step on stage.

“That is so. A masterpiece. That half-breed is the trash of society. Born as a rat crawling on the floor. From the start she was destined to silently age and die in some back alley…… and yet, look! That succubus was not only able to get into the highest firm in the demon world, she was able to become the mistress of a Demon Lord!”

“……”

“If this is not a masterpiece then what would it be. Is this pure desire to succeed not beautiful. Is this pure desire for power not blinding. Ooh, whenever I see a militant young lad like this I can’t help but shed a tear and praise out. Power is a lady! Thus, they will always only love warriors!”

%eb%8d%98%ec%a0%84-%eb%94%94%ed%8e%9c%ec%8a%a4-volume-1-page-207

 

The executives were overwhelmed by Ivar Lodbrok’s madness.

But I was a bit different.

My heart was pounding.

That was the madness that I had fallen for.

Like a mosquito born in a dark and moist swamp would yearn for the glorious sun. I, who was always normal and followed common-sense, couldn’t help but be attracted to Ivar Lodbrok who was located in the complete opposite of my position.

“Lapis Lazuli. Go and tell the Demon Lord! That we will gladly lend something like 10,000 gold whenever he desires!”

“I shall carry out your order at once, chief.”

“And that great desire to succeed where you had even offered your virginity just for our firm. Truthfully, I took a liking to it. Keuncuska is a place only concerned about one’s skills and contributions. You have more than enough rights to receive a reward. Tell me what you desire.”

Ivar Lodbrok spoke coldly.

“Is it gold? Is it honor? I could even offer to adopt you as my daughter. Your biggest weakness is probably your status, right? If you become my child then that weakness will disappear considerably.”

“Chief! No matter how much she has done that’s—”

“Do not impede on another person’s conversation, comrade.”

When the executives tried to oppose, Ivar Lodbrok silenced them.

“I’m trying to enjoy a conversation with this outcast who was able to entice a Demon Lord.”

Eyes as red as blood slowly gazed over the executives.

A thick killing intent. The executives shrunk back their shoulders. The air in the meeting room instantly became cold.

“So, Lapis Lazuli. Tell me what you desire.”

“Please prepare a seat for me in the executive meetings.”

The other executives were badly shaken.

A normal white-collar office worker had just requested to become an executive. It was impressive. However, there was something more impressive. What shocked the executives more was Ivar Lodbrok’s response.

“Not gold or honor, but authority. Okay then.”

“C-Chief……!”

“If the plan goes well, then I shall promote you to the executive in charge of the entire region of Dolstat. With the Rhine River as the center, Cologne, Xanten, Wirthen, Strasbourg, Duisburg, Worms, and Mainz will be in your jurisdiction. How is that?”

Ivar Lodbrok was examining the girl. He was most likely testing her boldness with his eyes.

“It would be an honor.”

“The strength of the Empire has weakened, so in accordance to that, the autonomy in these cities are at the highest point ever in history. As much as the development has suddenly changed, empty-headed people will be tossed to the side and only the true talented people will survive. Lapis Lazuli. I wonder if you will be able to withstand these conditions.”

“I will prove it with my ability.”

“Of course you will. Since if you took out ability, then you’d have nothing.”

For the second time, Ivar Lodbrok laughed loudly.

In the dark conference room, all the executives were dumbfounded. It was as if this old vampire and this cold succubus were in a world of their own.

I must admit, this had become an absurd situation.

To make a succubus who lacked a lot of experience, and was also a half-breed, into a branch manager. There was a limit to advancing quickly. This will be the first time in Keuncuska history, as well as it will be its last for this to happen.

“Keruruk.”

But, Demon Lord Dantalion, huh. I did get the feeling that we were looking down on him too much…… but oh well. He was only rank 71st anyways. It would be good enough to just put a decent amount of caution.

This was interesting. I ended up getting a bit excited too.

Let us enjoy playing around with his highness Demon Lord.

“…… Does your highness plan to stay in bed all day today as well?”

“If you think that I’m not doing anything just because I’m lying in bed, then you are heavily mistaken. Despite the way I am, the fate of the universe is being spread out in my head.”

Two months had already passed.

Ever since I had borrowed the gold, I had spent the past 2 months plainly doing things at my leisure. It had already become a daily routine for Lapis Lazuli to come find me and start sighing.

“The piled interest is already no less than 2,000 Libra.”

“Ah, this book is quite enjoyable.”

I was flipping through a book while lying down. The title of the book was <Chronicles of the Great Demon Lords and the Custom Laws That Were Derived From Them>.

The reason why I was reading this kind of literature was simple.

The information I had of this world was heavily leaned towards one side.

<Dungeon Attack> was a game where you played in the shoes of the human hero. Thanks to that, I may have been knowledgeable about the humans and their society, but I was ridiculously ignorant regarding the demon world.

At most, there was a vampire heroine that falls for the protagonist and thus surrenders to him. But that was it. That heroine never went into details about the demon world.

Well. It just meant that I had to study it on my own.

“Hoh. In this world, for a Demon Lord to attack another Demon Lord, they must have at least sent a declaration of war two times, huh. What a pointless place to stick to formality. Although, it is an impressive means to prevent war. Hm, hm.”

“If your highness continues to not take any measures like this, your highness will end up bankrupting within 3 months. Please be aware, your highness.”

“I want to eat some ice cream—”

“……”

She had probably realized that this side was completely ignoring her.

Lapis Lazuli pressed her forehead with her index finger and thumb. Although her face was still emotionless, I could judge by her mood that she was receiving a lot of stress.

I gave her a bold-faced smile.

“Do not worry. Since all the preparation is already complete.”

“…… My apologies, your highness. Excluding the order that your highness had given this one two months ago, has your highness done anything else?”

“That was all the preparation needed.”

About 50 days ago.

I had made Lapis Lazuli purchase a certain herb en masse. Right now, it was a plant that most people would only consider it to be merely a useless piece of greenery. However, I knew the future.

The current date was year 1505 on the Empire calendar.

This summer, an infectious disease will occur and spread across the entire continent.

In the future this disease will be known as the Black Death and spread throughout the continent as the symbol of fear. Nearly 40% of the entire population on the continent will be wiped out, making it so that calling it a nightmare wouldn’t be even remotely close to describing the event. In Dungeon Attack, the game started around the time that the Black Death had already passed…… to be exact, the game story started in the year 1515 on the Empire calendar.

A tragedy yet to have arrived. It was something I shouldn’t be concerned with, right? The interesting part was what came next.

This plague, surprisingly, had a cure.

The name was plainly ‘Black Herb’. Since it cured the Black Death, it was thus called Black Herb. The people of this world had a dreadful naming sense. They’d probably give an illegitimate child a better name.

‘Angel’s Herb’, ‘Goddess’ Mercy’, ‘Apollon’s Liver’, these kind of glittering nicknames followed after. However, this was also talk of the future. The summer of 1505 on the Empire calendar, before the plague had arrived, this Black Herb was simply a weed. In many regions, this was a plant that didn’t even have the honor of having a name.

That was it.

A weed.

It was a piece of greenery with absolutely no monetary value—

I, using all 10,000 gold coins, invested into this plant.

Truthfully, it was easy.

First, I made a contract with the smaller merchant firms around the continent. Next, through the smaller firms, I was able to form a contract with the pharmacists spread throughout the land. And finally, the pharmacists hired herb gatherers from cities and villages. Instantly, a three-way contract was signed. The broker and transportation fee for the small firms, 2,000 gold coins. The pharmacy fee and herb gatherers’ personnel expenses, 6,000 gold coins. In addition, in order to be able to keep the herbs as fresh as possible, I had obtained a semi-permanent storage of the highest quality.

I was still not used to this world’s customs, but it was fine. I planned big wherever I was. All the detailed(lazy) affairs were handled by Lapis Lazuli as a proxy.

The person to go around making contracts with the small firms and pharmacists was not myself, but Lapis Lazuli. Some could say we were a good match. We were quite the amazing combination.

People who didn’t know the inside story would probably burst out in laughter if they saw this.

He had borrowed 10,000 Libra and we were curious as to see what he would do with it, but would you look at that. He bought a bunch of plants that weren’t even used to eat, and was storing them as if they were some sort of treasure.
Lapis Lazuli had tipped me off on what the executives at the firm were saying, ‘That’s the biggest joke I’ve heard all year’, they said and laughed their heads off, is what she told me.

Demon Lord Dantalian’s antics were even the talk of the town.

‘The foolish act of the lowest and crazy Demon Lord.’

‘10,000 gold coins worth of bullshit.’

‘Throwing his life away just for some attention!’

etc etc

I was incredibly pleased.

To be able to put laughter into other people’s lives with such trifling matters. Was this not the true fruits of life? Besides, we all lived an endlessly hard and dry life. If I was able to put a smile on these people’s faces then I could not be more happy.

Was I serious?

That’s why I’ll be making it more interesting.

Not the best joke you’ve heard all year, but the best joke you will ever hear in your entire life. ‘The plant that we thought was just a weed was actually as rare as a jewel!’, that was the kind of ending that awaited. If you had common sense, then you could only laugh till your insides shook.

“I truly am curious as to what face you will show me in a month.”

“Pardon?”

“Since you display no emotions all year round. It’ll be alright for you to look forward to it. I will most certainly make you laugh.”

“…… This one does not understand what your highness is talking about.”

“Wait patiently and you will know everything.”

While rolling around on my bed, I giggled.

Was it because I had teased her a bit too much. A notice popped up.

[Merchant Lapis Lazuli’s affection went down by 1.]

Oh dear. With this, Lapis Lazuli’s affection had become 0. It had been dropping since 2 months ago, and now it had finally reached the bottom. A stranger would probably treat me better than her now.

“Apologies, but this one shall take her leave here. There is a lot of paperwork from the firm that has been pushed back.

Lapis Lazuli coldly turned her back towards me.

“Ah, Lala.”

“What is it?”

“Take this with you.”

I tossed her a piece of parchment.

Lapis Lazuli received the note with both hands.

“…… your highness. This is?”

I gave her a playful wink.

“It is fine to not return to my castle for the time being. Instead, go to that location and look at the situations there. Since you will discover something interesting.”

After Lapis Lazuli gave me a gaze full of a suspicion, she soon departed.

That piece of paper was the last trap. Lapis Lazuli will most likely realize the existence of the trap much later. I look forward to that day.
▯Keuncuska Merchant, Mixed Blood, Lapis Lazuli
Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 6, Day 27
Syracuse Relaxation Hot Springs

“Haa……”

Sighs kept coming out. I wonder how many times that made it now.

The great Keuncuska executive candidate, Lapis Lazuli, was currently at a hot spring. It was a place where the citizens enjoyed taking baths. Men and women were proudly walking in front of me in the nude.

Although I’m saying this, I too was unclothed. Men would stroll through the halls and look this way with an obscene gaze. Their eyes were incredibly unpleasant…… I wanted to crush the eyes of each and every one of these men.

Hot springs were not only a place for relaxation, but it was a type of love area as well. In other words, you could say people were dating in the nude.

A man and a woman would go into a spring and naturally start to philander. It was a kind of culture. Even now, I could hear the sound of moaning over on the side…… I was desperately keeping my head turned away.

“Haa.”

Another sigh.

There was a reason, that was so simple that it was shocking, as to why I was here in Syracuse, the southmost area in the continent. In the note that his highness Dantalian had passed onto me had contained strange words.

    Sardinia Kingdom, Syracuse, Citizen Bathhouse, Clinic
    Starting point
    Joint pain, high temperature, skin turning black

At glance, if one had no context then it’d appear like some code.

His highness Dantalian had been mentioning a disease for the past two months now. At the time, I had misunderstood that it was just his highness purposely saying nonsense. However, after seeing him write this note and pass it on to me, it seemed he was actually serious about it…… This was a joke, right? Anyone was fine, so please tell me this was a joke.
Was that so. Was there no one.

“Haa.”

I had sighed for the third time already.

Diseases themselves were not rare. Regardless, to predict when and where a disease would appear? In addition to that, to also already know what the cure to that disease was? That was impossible. That was why it was natural that the executives were treating his highness as a madman.

Honestly, it may have been a little amount, but I had hopes.

His highness, who was once helpless but had overcome a life or death situation, to be reborn as a true Demon Lord…… That kind of folktale-like story, it may have been a small amount, but I had hopes for it.

But rank 71st.

Was he just an idiot that was beyond remedy.

Demon Lord Dantalian really did absolutely nothing after having bought all those plants. He only rolled around on his newly bought bed like a child. It was honestly pathetic.

“Ooh. Lady, you’re quite the pretty one.”

A pedestrian who was also using the bath tried to talk to me.

I was currently using magic to disguise myself as a human. It may had been magic but it was nothing impressive. I had only changed my hair color to red. Succubi were a demonic race, but their outer appearance was pretty much identical to that of a human. I was able to simply conceal my identity.

“How ’bout it, in a single pool for 3 silver…… euut!?”

“……”

I looked into the man’s eyes for a moment.

He had probably mistaken me for some prostitute working in this bath, so I had returned him a cold gaze. As soon as we made eye contact he had taken a step back.

It seems that there was a peculiar murderous intent hidden in my eyes. There were not a lot of people who were able to stare me straight in the face. As the person directly involved, I didn’t understand that well.

“S-Sorry. I mistook you for someone else. Have a nice day!”

The man hastily ran back out to the halls.

His fleshy waist shook violently as he ran. It was pathetic. How could he have expected to buy me with 3 silver coins with a body like that. At the very least 10 gold. If he did not offer that much then an exchange itself couldn’t possibly be established. No matter how I looked, men who couldn’t judge their appearance objectively were all shabby.

I turned my steps towards the clinic of the hot springs. There were many patients here who got admitted believing in the effects of the hot springs. If perhaps, in a one in a million chance, his highness Dantalian’s prediction about the disease was correct, then this was the starting point.

“Ah. What can we do for you, ma’am?”

The doctors welcomed me. They thought I was the daughter of some noble family. That a pure maiden, ignorant of worldly affairs, was coming to do volunteer work. Yes, I had used charm and suggestion magic to purposely delude them.

“How are the patients?”

“Well, it’s pretty much the same. Day in, day out they groan and moan about it hurting. Truthfully speaking, the majority of the patients here are completely fine.”

“I’d like to meet the most recent patient.”

“There’s a bloke who was brought in just yesterday. But I don’t really recommend for you to visit him, miss.”

“Is there a reason?”

“Yeah. This guy’s fake illness is rather serious. My armpit hurts, my groin feels like it’s ripping, and so on. Talk about fussing over nothing. You’ll detest it, miss.”

“……”

 

Joint pain

 

“……no. That is alright. If it’s a patient, then I’d like to trust his words for now. I’d like to meet that person first.”

“Haa. How good-natured of you. I may be a petty doctor, but it’s been a long time since I’ve met someone as sincere as you, miss.”

While being delighted, the doctor led me to the sick ward. As soon as we had opened the door, a patient who was further inside started to holler.

“Aaah, I’m dying! This merchant for the great land of Syracuse is going to die because of a quack! Townspeople! Someone beat that quack up for me!” (TL note: Quack = Fake doctor)

“Gah. He’s like a pig in heat.”

The doctor sighed.

I understood why he had warned me about visiting this patient. The doctor, after taking a quick glance at me first, approached the patient.

“So what’s the problem this time, that’s making you have an epileptic fit?”

“Problem? What’s my problem? All right, I’ll explain it to you one more time, so this time make sure to carve it into your ear. First, the bed is so hard that my spine is about to become flat. Second, I’m not sure if the servants here are bringing me bread or stones, but my teeth are about to break apart. Third, the long-term doc friend I had keeps sighing whenever he sees my face and that’s starting to make my life miserable.”

“You, moron. My life is becoming miserable because of you.”

“Yeah? Good. We have finally reached the point where we make each other miserable. But that’s the same with the missus as well. My wife and I have been at each other’s throat for a while now, and at this point we’re only thinking of ways to screw with each other. Oi, pal. If you aren’t planning to become my second wife, then shit! Hurry up and act like a doctor and fix me up!”

“Damn it. This guy isn’t even helpful in life.”

It seemed that these two had been friends since they were kids.

It meant that they were close enough to be able to freely swear at each other’s faces.

It was a strange scene for someone like myself. Friendship. Could that actually exist?

Commonly, people would praise that friendships last forever. It was suspicious. No matter what sentence, whenever the adverb ‘forever’ was included, then I’d start off by being doubtful. I personally thought this was a good habit.

There were only backstabbers or potential backstabbers that existed in the world. That was my opinion. Friendship simply referred to a person who hadn’t betrayed you yet.

“Sorry, miss.”

The doctor abruptly apologized.

“This guy always had a crude mouth. Just think of it as his limit of education and ignore it if you can.”

“I am okay. Please proceed with the checkup.”

“Okay then.”

The doctor placed his hand on the patient’s forehead.

“Places here and there are indeed hot. But no matter how I see it, it’s just a summer cold. I’ll prescribe you with some medicine, so if it does get bad then take the medicine. Other than that you should be fine, so don’t worry.”

“……”

 

High temperature

 

For an instant, disbelief had crossed my mind.

…… There was no way. I was overthinking it. Joints aching and having a fever, these were symptoms you could find anywhere. You couldn’t consider something like these to be a sign of a disease.

“Eh, how do you expect me to believe the words of a quack?”

“If you keep calling me a quack, I’m going to prescribe you poison instead. If you keep saying something like that so loudly then you’ll be hurting my dignity. You bastard. Are you planning to ruin your childhood friend’s business like this?”

“It really hurts like hell! Here, look.”

The patient suddenly pulled his top off.

The doctor panicked and turned to look at me, but I was the same as ever and stood calmly. I didn’t care about the naked body of a man at all. More than that, there was something else that had caught my gaze.

The patient’s right chest.

There was a black spot the size of a thumb.

“…………”

My entire body went stiff.

Like a person who was petrified.

“Ara, what’s this?”

“There’s no reason to have this bruise if it was a normal cold.”

“That, well. I guess you’re right……”

The two didn’t notice my sudden change in mood.

The doctor and patient were busy discussing with each other.

“That’s weird. Did you perhaps catch an endemic disease from someone else?”

“That’s something you, the doctor, should know. Not the merchant, you quack. If you don’t want to get a job change to an undertaker, then cure me already. If I end up being a corpse by tomorrow then you don’t have to worry about your reputation, because your life as a doctor will be over.”

“Bah, spitting out annoying words, this dumbass.”

 

Skin turning black

 

“…… I just recalled something that I have to do. I shall take my leave.”

“Ah? Oh, sure. Stay safe.”

With fast steps, I made my way out of the ward.

I did not have the leisure to give a proper farewell at the moment.

The situation.

I couldn’t understand the situation.

Turmoil wrapped around my head and shook it violently. What was going on? Surely, you weren’t telling me that a disease was actually starting to run rampant? And for it to also be according to Demon Lord Dantalian’s prediction?

That was impossible. That was absolutely impossible. The ability to foretell the future only manifested in the smallest amount of the already small amount of saintesses. Even then, the last recognized case of a prophecy coming true was 210 years ago. There was no chance for his highness Dantalian to have such an ability, or it was supposed to be that way. But why?

…… I had to be calm. It was too soon to get ahead of myself. At most, it was only one patient. There was still the chance that it was just a coincidence that a patient with the symptoms that matched the nonsense that his highness Dantalian had spouted was here. For starters, I had to visit the other doctors in Syracuse.

At least 2, no, at least 4 patients had to have the same symptoms before it could be judged as a disease. I must not panic. Prophecies were fantasies that appeared in story books. There was no way they could happen so easily in real life.

‘But, if his highness Dantalian was right……’

A simple speculation.

I had only thought of it for a moment but the back of my neck was already cold.

His highness Dantalian, claiming they were the cure to the disease, had bought bulks of a certain weed. Naturally, the price of the leaf was incredibly low. Most of the gold was spent on personnel. Due to the exorbitant price, however, the amount of the plant that his highness Dantalian had bought……

Was no less than 30,000.

If those truly were the cure, then no matter how low the price was, they’d sell for at least 2 gold each. Thus, 60,000 gold coins. That transcended the amount that his highness had initially borrowed.

No, that was still the situation where the money earned was set to the least. If the contagion were to spread across the entire continent then it could cost 5 gold…… it would reach a preposterous state. An unprecedented amount of chaos would occur.

No one in the firm would predict this. A blunder among blunders. They will probably find the one responsible to blame, and ten to one, I will end up being that scapegoat.

The goal of becoming an executive in Keuncuska.

The promise to leave me in charge of the entire region of Dolstat, as well.

Naturally, all of these will pop like bubbles.

“……”

I carefully bit my lips.

Born in a back alley, I had lived my life scavenging sewers and trash. I had just barely been able to grab hold of an opportunity to escape that hell. I could not let all that go down the drain.

Certainly, I had hoped that his higness Dantalian would awaken as an actual Demon Lord. However, his awakening was only meant for my success and growth. Thus, I had never considered this situation.

My feet moved faster on their own.

On that day alone, I had visited every doctor in the city of Syracuse. And I had no choice but to give an objective conclusion.

Severe fevers.

Pain spreading from the joints.

A symptom where the skin would turn black in areas.

“……”

In my hands was the piece of parchment that his highness had handed me. Standing in the center of the city square, I kept staring down at the note for a long time.

16 clinics in the city of Syracuse.

29 patients with similar symptoms.

The next day the patients increased to 56 people.

25 patients complained of a sharp pain and then died.

10 days later, the patients in the hot springs that I had visited before had all died. Half a month later, the entire city was filled with the pained cries of the citizens.

His highness Dantalian’s prediction was correct.

 

It was an epidemic.

An epidemic was going rampant.
▯Keuncuska Executive, Miser Goblin, Torukel
Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 7, Day 16
Keuncuska Firm, Amstel Branch

“Sir Torukel, an emergent report has arrived.”

“Keruruk. You discourteous fellow! Did I not tell you that no matter what happens, to not bother me when her highness Paimon was visiting!”

A fancy reception room.

I had gotten upset because of a secretary that had suddenly started pounding on the door.

Her highness Paimon was sitting across from me, that idiot. She was one of the most precious guests to the Keuncuska Firm. When this person was visiting, be it work or contact, I had forbade everything. This was a problem of common courtesy!

“Oh dear. This lady is fine, Torukel.”

Fortunately, her highness had displayed understanding first.

“It must be quite the urgent matter if he had to come in contact with you immediately.”

“I sincerely apologize. That secretary normally isn’t like this……”

“I said that I was fine. This lady will be enjoying the fragrance of the tea, so you may take your time.”

Her highness Paimon smiled gently.

I wonder how benevolent this person was. She would always treat me, a lowly merchant, with gentleness. While being moved, I bowed several times.

Of course, once I had left the reception room, my expression had twisted.

“You fool. What is it, keruk?”

“I-I’m sorry.”

The secretary lowered his head while being nervous.

Even if you did that, the thought of forgiving you doesn’t come up. How dare he interrupt a meeting with her highness. Having come this far, it wouldn’t even be satisfying to cut his head off. He better be prepared.

“An urgent message had arrived from the firm headquarters. A mage wrote down the information onto a note and has delivered it.”

“No matter how urgent the message is, the person in that room is her highness Paimon. If the message turns out to be a matter of no importance, then I personally will cut your head off.”

“S-Sir Torukel……!”

“Hm.”

I quickly snatched the note away from the secretary and scanned it. Just like our firm to put importance on efficiency, only brief words were written down. Additionally, it was written in a code that only the executives understood, so I was the sole person here that was able to read it.

    An epidemic outbreak.
    Centering the harbors, the plague has spread throughout the entire region of the Sardinia Kingdom.
    It is certain that it will spread to the countries in the vicinity soon.
    Fatality rate: 80%

“What……?”

Once I had decoded this far, my brows creased.

For it to say that the fatality rate was 80%. Doesn’t that mean that if 10 people were to catch the disease, then 8 people would die? This wasn’t a normal contagious disease.

It also stated that it was ‘certain’ that the disease will spread to the countries in the vicinity. This was also serious. It was a rule for merchants to not exaggerate information. In these type of situations, it was normal to write that it was ‘expected’ to spread.

Surely, Ivar Lodbrok couldn’t have possibly made a mistake on this part……
Certain? Did it mean that the epidemic was spreading at that much of an incredible rate? This was not good. An ominous premonition was looming over me……

The following sentences made my pupils stop.

    The cure to the disease is in the Demon Lord Dantalian’s possession.
    Currently estimated value, 1,200,000~3,000,000 gold coins.
    All executives are to return to the headquarters immediately.

(TL note: I’m not very sure about the value. It might be referring to the amount that Dantalian will make in total. Cause 1,200,000 gold per plant sounds insane)

“…………”

This didn’t make sense.

“I-I am sorry. Sir Torukel. I truly am sorry. I too, wanted to wait till her highness Paimon had left before handing this to you.”

This couldn’t be happening.

“To tell you the truth, this was a note delivered about an hour ago.  But it was branded with the first class classified seal. I thought it’d be troublesome for Sir Torukel if it were to be delayed any further……”

It was impossible.

“S-Sir Torukel? Are you listening to me? Sir Torukel……?”

▯Keuncuska Firm Owner, Pure-blood Vampire, Ivar Lodbrok
Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 7, Day 16
Keuncuska Firm Headquarters, Highest floor

We were tricked.

Honestly, I was completely deceived.

“Hmm.”

In a dark room I was drinking wine by myself.

My glass continued to empty. It meant that I was that deep in thought. Somehow, it felt like I was going to be drinking till late at night, tonight……

Who was it. Which person was the one to have made Ivar Lodbrok into a fool.

Demon Lord Dantalian was a small-fry. He lacked the ability to plot such a grandiose plan. Then who was it.
There was only one answer. The half-breed succubus, that girl was the one who had schemed everything……

“Lapis Lazuli.”

While rolling the fragrance of the wine around my mouth, I spoke the girl’s name. Was it just my imagination. The alcohol tasted a bit sweeter.

The desire to succeed was beautiful. To not be satisfied with one’s current position and continue to aim higher. That was the attitude that everyone should naturally take. That was my thought.

Except.

If you show your fangs towards me then the story became different.

I will now teach Lapis Lazuli a lesson.

It was unfortunate that I had to stomp on a junior who had such a promising future ahead of them. I was speaking the truth. If you asked what I meant by that, then it was because Lapis Lazuli was going to become a living but not living doll.

I hold out my glass.

“Another cup.”

“……”

A servant girl poured more wine without a word.

At one point, this girl too was a promising executive candidate. She was just like Lapis Lazuli. Having a low status, her desire for power was mesmerizing. The beauty of her eyes were peerless. However, the decisive part was that she was a fool. She had revolted against none other than myself.

The bright eyes that would always shine with intelligence, was now a hazy and achromatic color.

Having lost her will and consciousness, she had dropped down to being a slave doll that obeyed my every command……

“What a shame. Why is it that all the useful talents can’t resist the temptation to go against me?”

A sigh came out on its own.

I had turned my head towards the side, and there my face was reflected by the window. Surprisingly, I was grinning. Uncontainable joy was floating around the corners of my mouth. It appeared as if I was having a fair amount of fun.

It was true.

The fact of it being a shame was a lie.

What’s there to hide.

Personally, I was having the most fun I’ve ever had since forever.

For an unpredictable twist to occur, that was the joy of life.

To personally be able to trample the junior with a promising career ahead of them, those were the fruits of life.

To turn that junior into a puppet, and like one would store wine to mature, to store her like a doll in my own personal collection—

That was the highest of pleasures.

“Lapis Lazuli.”

Once again.

I murmured the name of that beautiful girl.

I will cut every last hope that you have.

I will defile you from head to toe.

Once you fall into despair and begin to flounder, I shall pierce my fangs into your white neck and make you into my slave for eternity.

“Mm.”

I couldn’t hold back any longer.

I pushed my teeth into the servant’s neck.

“……Ah, aah…… aaaah……”

The servant shuddered slightly.

Her conscience may have been gone, but her sense of pain remained.

The fragrance of her blood was like that of a well matured first grade wine.

I had collected wine dolls like her for the past hundreds of years.

But for the past 60 years, the number of dolls had stopped at 32. Because people had stopped showing defiance towards me. It was a boring time.

The true owner of the Keuncuska Firm. Richest person in the demon world. One of the three pure vampires to walk this land. All of these were addressed to myself. Young ones brave enough to go against me were extremely rare.

In that meaning, Lapis Lazuli was the first obstacle to appear in 60 years. She was precious in that regard, and she was also precious as my 33rd wine.

…… Now that I thought about it. In my collection there was an elf, a witch, a werewolf, a centaur, a mermaid, and more. I had all kinds of races but not a succubus. Thus, Lapis Lazuli’s value as a collection piece was higher.

I do wonder what fragrance of wine she’ll give off.

I sucked the blood of the servant until she had fainted and laughed.

Keuncuska, oh great Keuncuska.

You shall repay blood with blood.

▯Weakest Demon Lord, Rank 71st, Dantalian
Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 7, Day 16
Dantalian’s Demon Lord Castle

Life was beautiful.

To the point that, I, the most pessimistic person in history, should slowly start to admit that the world was beautiful as well.

According to the setting in Dungeon Attack, Demons Lords did not have parents. If you were asking what I was talking about, I was referring to the fact that Demon Lords were born from magical energy abnormally gathered at a single point. Purely made by chance. Their birth had nothing to do with having a good personality or being talented, it all relied on luck……

That was why people couldn’t help but look down on them.

It was like a competent peasant scorning an incompetent noble. People who had reached the top through their talent and ability alone looked down on Demon Lords. ‘They were only born as a Demon Lord by chance anyways. They wouldn’t be a challenge if you faced them head on.’, was what they’d say.

They were carelessly letting their guards down.

And it was fatal for someone to drop their guard, for even a second, around someone as villainous as I was.

There were only two cases where I’d think that the world was beautiful.

First, it was when I did absolutely nothing and rolled around on my bed.

The second, was when I stabbed a dagger into the people who underestimated me on their own. During these times were when I felt like I understood the true meaning of life.

…… My little sister said that this was a perverted preference and fiercely denounced it. But I didn’t get her. Was it not the person who lowered their guard that was at fault?

When a lion hunts a rabbit, they put their all into the hunt. That was why hunting was an incredibly tiring job. If you were not going to do your best from the beginning, then it was better off not starting the work in the first place. Half-assed work only returned half-assed results. It would be more efficient to just be like me and laze around all day and save energy.

If one had to endure their laziness and go hunting, then in one hit.

Kill the game off without giving it a single chance to resist.

Currently, the result of that was spread before me.

“Ooh, Lala. Your complexion looks rather dark today.”

“……”

Lapis Lazuli was standing silently.

Her expression wasn’t as sharp as it used to be. The eyes of hers, which used to be as transparent as glass, were unclear now. They were eyes that I had seen a countless number of times before, the eyes of a defeated person.

“Is it perhaps, that? The magical spell that falls upon women every month? You too, have a rough life.”

“…… how did your highness predict this.”

“Oh dear, Lala. I can hear impatience in your words.”

Like the reclining Buddha statue, I was lying while supporting my head with my arm.(TL note: This pose)

“Always cool-headed and calm, that is your charm. Please do show some more consideration to your beauty.”

Lapis Lazuli’s complexion grew darker.

A pitiful fellow.

Regardless, I rather liked mentally tantalizing the loser. Please partake in my ridiculing a bit longer.

“What is the reaction from the Keuncuska Firm?”

“…… It was like a stirred bee hive. A call up order for all the executives was sent out only a few hours ago. This one had also received the summons to come to the headquarters immediately.”

“Oh ho. Then why are you here instead of going to the firm?”

“……”

Lapis Lazuli didn’t respond.

No, it would be correct to say that she wasn’t able to respond.

I smiled slyly.

“Should I guess what you’re thinking? You had judged that your life would be in danger if you were to go to the firm now. The firm executives have no idea that I was the one to have planned all of this. In their minds, the culprit to this incident was you, Lapis Lazuli.”

Lapis Lazuli glared at me.

Like a wounded beast staring with hatred at their hunter in the last moment.

“Was that why your highness had sent this one to Syracuse? To plant a misunderstanding in the firm executives. This one, on purpose.”

“Correct.”

If you thought logically, then the act of predicting a plague was impossible. Someone, mobilizing unknown methods, had spread the disease in Syracuse on purpose. That was the normal conclusion people would come to.

Who could that person be.

Who would the firm executives point their fingers at, as the criminal.

“The person to become the concubine of a Demon Lord and entice him, was also you.”

There was one woman who had captivated Dantalian with their body.

“The one to have seduced the Demon Lord into borrowing a large amount of gold from the firm, was also you.”

There was one woman who had passionately convinced the executives that it was the perfect opportunity to put a collar on the Demon Lord.

“Coincidentally, the person to have stayed in the area where the disease had first spread, for a week at that, was also you.

There was one woman who had first reported exactly where the Black Death outbreak initially occured—.

“Finally, the person to have bought several thousands of the plant that could cure said disease, was none other than you.”

That was so.

Just for this, I had left all the detailed affairs to Lapis Lazuli. The meeting of the small firms and pharmacy, and also the process of buying the plant. All the paperwork was done through Lapis Lazuli.

Now then.

“Now your firm executives have no other choice but to suspect you as the prime suspect.”

The most that Demon Lord Dantalian was, in this act, was a puppet controlled by the succubus. The one pulling the strings was the half-breed, Lapis Lazuli, was what all the executives would assume.

Although they were completely wrong.

I chuckled.

“Lala, you should have thought this far as well. That’s why you came here instead of returning to your headquarters. A good judgment. If you had gone to your headquarters you would have been punished, no questions asked.”

Silence took over for a moment.

In a ruin-like Demon Lord room, previously destroyed by adventurers, excluding the bed the room was full of dust and rubbish, in this grey room, Lapis Lazuli was the first to break the silence.

“…… why?”

Lapis Lazuli slowly opened her mouth.

“Why is your highness revealing everything to this one?”

“Because I evaluate you very highly, Lala.”

I stood from my bed.

“You are beautiful. I’m not complimenting your looks. I’m referring to your inner beauty.”

Rolling my snake-like tongue, I approached Lapis Lazuli.

“Despite being born a half-breed outcast, you did not throw away your passion for authority. You even tried to sacrifice a Demon Lord for your own success. Just one more step. If you were able to take one more step, you could have become an executive at Keuncuska……”

An unusual amount of lust for power.

Cool-headedness that did not fear sacrifice.

Adding to that, talent that leaped over one’s origin and rank.

“I want to obtain you.”

I lifted Lapis Lazuli’s chin.

Endlessly blue eyes looked up at me.

“Abandon the Keuncuska Firm and come under my command. Keuncuska, in the end, is nothing more than a firm. Money may be great but it is not greater than authority. The thing that truly excites and enthuses people is authority.”

“…… Your highness has only just succeeded.”

Lapis Lazuli spoke quietly.

Our faces were so close that we could feel each others’ breaths.

“Of course, your highness will make a lot of money. However, there won’t be any authority there yet. Your highness is still rank 71st, the lowest Demon Lord, there is no adequate foundation. How does your highness plan to present authority to this one?”

“I shall leave all the trading of the cure to you.”

“……”

Lapis Lazuli hesitated.

I slowly moved my face closer to hers. I did not rush. She was already caught in the center of the spider web. She could not run away.

“Close your eyes. Imagine. The continent will scream as the nightmare like plague envelopes over it. No matter how short it lasts, 2 years. If it goes on longer, then over 5 years. Hundred and thousands of people, hundreds and thousands of people will die off. Among them there will be nobles and the rich. They, in order to stay alive, will do whatever they can to struggle.”

Lapis Lazuli, listening to my order, closed her eyes.

In a soft voice, I whispered into her ear.

“This cure that will allow you to control these people’s lives, I shall give it to you.”

“……”

“Countless number of people in power will run to you in order to trade. If you sell the cure, then those people in power will live. If you don’t sell the cure, then those people in power will meet their end. A single word from you could make numerous authorities delighted, despair, sad, and regret for eternity……”

I stroke her hip with a hand.

Lapis Lazuli, albeit weakly, furrowed her brows.

With my palm, I faintly felt her skin. It was a smooth body with no useless fat. As if I was searching through the unknown, I passed my hand over here and there of her body.

From her chest to her stomach.

From her stomach to her waist.

“Half-breed. The rubbish of demons. Daughter of a whore. An outcast. You who used to be condemned by these names and scorned will instantly grasp the lives of hundreds and thousands of people. How is it, Lala. How is that feeling, Lapis Lazuli.”

It was then, I felt something hard against my finger.

I found it.

“The thing you’re feeling right now, that is authority.”

I daringly pushed my hand into her clothes.

Lapis Lazuli furrowed her brows further. Did she think that she would be violated here? While being all smiles, I pulled out the round metallic object that was hidden underneath the waist of Lapis Lazuli’s clothes. Once I did so, Lapis Lazuli let out an “ah” sound while opening her mouth. It was a look of surprise.

It was silver-colored metal object.

At first glance it appeared to be a pocket watch. But if it was a real watch, then the key used to coil around the clockwork was supposed to be connected to the watch. This object didn’t have a watch chain.

“This is why I evaluate you highly.”

I playfully waved the metallic object in front of her eyes.

Lapis Lazuli bit her lips.

“…… Did your highness perhaps know from the start?”

“Well, it was a simple guess.”

Memory Play, a magic artifact.

It was a type of recording device that recorded audio and saved it. If the quality was good, then it could even record videos like a video camera.

This was an item that sold for a tremendous price in Dungeon Attack. It was most likely the same in this world as well.

Lapis Lazuli most likely wanted to prove her innocence to the firm executives. The problem was that she didn’t have any proof. Thus, Lapis Lazuli was going to make new evidence……

What evidence could prove her innocence. The most effective way would obviously be to get the confession from the actual culprit. There was no doubt that she would mobilize the use of the Memory Play artifact.

“It is sad. Mm, it has become quite unfortunate. If you did well, there was still the chance to become a proud branch manager in the Keuncuska Firm, but. Oh goodness. Would you look at that—.”

I dropped the silver object to the floor.

And then, raising my right foot, I stomped down using the heel of my boot.

With a ‘crack’, you could hear the precise sound of mechanical parts breaking. I repeated the action 5 times. I then picked up the already wrecked device and tossed it as hard as I could at a wall.

I shrugged.

“It seems your last possibility has broken.”

“……”

“Lala. You have two choices in front of you. These are choices that you can not refuse. First choice. Like this, abide to your summons from the firm and return with no evidence. Earnestly plea your innocence there. Then, hm. Then…… if you’re lucky then you might be able to keep your life.”

I softly tapped her shoulder.

“…… What is the second choice?”

Lapis Lazuli spoke. It was splendid. Despite being checkmated her voice was still cold. No matter what desperate situation this girl was in, even if her life was on the line, it was clear as day that she would maintain calmness.
Like I did three months ago.
While surrounded by adventurers.

“Come under my wing. Lapis Lazuli. Oh, half-breed low one. If you devote to me your talent, then I will provide you status. If you devote to me your loyalty, then I shall give you power. I will make true the hopes and desires that you contain in your chest on this land, and you shall protect me from the hopes and desires of other people.”

In brief, give and take.

Was this not the most loveable logic.

“What will your highness do if this one was to betray your highness.”

“Ah, don’t be mistaken. I am not asking for absolute loyalty from you. If you wish to betray me, then do so. If you think someone other than myself will be able to give you more benefits, then of course you should.”

I did not believe in friendship.

I did not believe in love more.

Similarly, I did not have any trust in loyalty.

“But I will promise you this, you will enjoy to the fullest the highest power of authority.”

What I did believe in was equivalent exchange.

The act of reasonable people exchanging items of the same value.

“……”

“……”

Lapis Lazuli stared at me. I did not avoid her eyes. Silence was only awkward when there was no meaning in each others’ eyes. We still had much to figure out from each other’s gaze.

I had something inside of myself.

And she as well, had something hidden inside of her.

We had no reason to fear silence.

 

At last.

“I understand, your highness.”

Lapis Lazuli got down onto one knee.

She looked to the floor and vowed.

“I, Lapis Lazuli, born from a Humbaba succubus and raised in the back alleys of towns and cities, a person to have worked as a third degree merchant for the Keuncuska Firm for 10 years, shall forget her past and live solely for the purpose of being Demon Lord Dantalian’s subordinate. This heart. This head. This soul, shall forever be in the possession of your highness.”

As soon as her oath of fealty was over several notices appeared.

[Lapis Lazuli has been recruited as a subordinate.]

[The degree of loyalty will appear in Lapis Lazuli’s status.]

[Unstable loyalty. The other party purely regards you as a lord contractually. The other party can betray you at any time.]

I smiled.

I especially took fancy to the line of being betrayed at any moment. Be it sticky friendship or eternal affection, instead of high-flown lines like those, that line was more trustworthy.

The undying love that my father had vowed with my mothers, in the end, met with failure. Humans didn’t have the strength to revere that kind of love. To dump emotions that you both can’t handle onto one another will only bend your knees.

Dry from the start.

Instead of being bothered by such useless things, I’d rather be lazy.

Instead of being crudely serious, I’d rather be seriously crude.

This was my creed, my ironclad rules.

All of a sudden, from my memories, my father’s thick lips moved clearly.

‘Son. Be prepared.’

‘No matter what you choose—’

‘You will live a life more harsh than I.’

Sorry, father.

I do not plan to repeat the life you had.

You had succeeded as a member of society. However, you had horribly failed as a husband. I had been displeased by that since long ago. Why would you be obsessed with something when you know you would fail?

If you weren’t certain to succeed then don’t dive in. That was my answer. It meant that people wouldn’t have to be in despair because of me. You were the one remorse in my life, father. I do not want to be the remorse of another person……

“Good. Lapis Lazuli.”

I got on my knee as well to match her eye level.

We were not simply lord and vassal. Contractor and contractee. We were partners made on a promise of equal rights. I wanted to express that to her with my body.

“I, Dantalian, shall never return thy advice with silence and shall never return thy suggestions with scorn. If thou sweat and bleed for my behalf, then I shall repay every drop of sweat and blood.”

I held her hand tightly.

I had felt it before, but her hand really was soft.

Lapis Lazuli, after looking at me for a long time, slightly, ever so slightly nodded her head.

“…… My service to you, your highness.”

Three months since having fallen into this world.

I had appointed my first vassal.

▯Keuncuska Executive, Miser Goblin, Torukel
Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 7, Day 20
Keuncuska Firm Headquarters

The firm headquarters was more unsettled than usual.

Goblins were looking deeply into crystal balls and deciphering codes. And with the deciphered codes, they’d write it down on a piece of parchment in one stroke, then passed it on to a fairy.

Fairies the size of a palm groaned as they moved the parchment. From the operating department to the countermeasure department, distribution department, and the high-officer department. The headquarters was a rather large building, and yet the fairies were moving around so much that traffic congestion could be seen near the ceiling.

“Reports of a patient being discovered in Cologne!”

“We’re certain that the plague is following the Rhine River and spreading north.”

“That made the closure of the Sardinia Kingdom completely useless.”

“The lady of the House of Sforza has fallen due to illness……”

Reports from all over the continent were arriving en masse. Headaches were wrapping around the employees. Among them, there was a goblin that had presumably skipped sleep for the past few days because his eyes were bloodshot and swelling. Keruruk, how pitiful.

Going through the headquarters, I made my way straight to Ivar Lodbrok’s personal office. For a second, I had thought that I had entered the wrong room. There were so many piles of papers stacked up, that you couldn’t even see the form of Ivar Lodbrok. If I hadn’t heard his gloomy voice over the heaps of papers, then I would most definitely have left the room.

“Is that Torukel.”

“Quite horrible. Keruk.”

“Oho, is this horrible. But it’s going to be more horrible later. Sit.”

“…… to sit, where?”

Of course the desk was out of the question, but there were piles of parchments all over the floor as well.

“Anywhere is fine. I have already put all the information over there in my head, anyway.”

“A freakish memorizing ability as ever…… So, is the plague showing any signs of dying down?”

“Not at all.”

Ivar Lodbrok replied instantly.

“The disease is spreading at a terrifying speed. Kalmar Union and the kingdom of Moscow, excluding Venetia, are all eroding to the plague. The remaining countries will also face the disease very soon. Our firm analysts are already predicting a 30% casualty rate.”

“30% of the entire continent is going to die? Are you joking?”

“If I had ever told a joke in my entire life, do tell.”

I unintentionally murmured to myself. 30%. It was unimaginable. It meant that millions of demons and humans will die. I couldn’t even speculate how bad the damage was going to be.

“Every lord has temporarily ceased all trade with our firm.”

Ivar Lodbrok spoke in a tone as if he was enjoying something.

Was he going to keep up with his jovial attitude even in this situation? He really wasn’t sane. Wait, more important than that, did he just say that every lord had ceased trades with us?

“Isn’t that a big deal!?”

“Aah, it is a big deal. They are afraid that we will deliver not only the product but the disease as well. Due to that, the items we had prepared for a long time now are waiting in the cargos and storages only to rot.”

“Don’t tell me the other firms too……”

“They are the same. All commerce has stopped.”

It was an unprecedented crisis.

This plague wasn’t bringing harm to solely mankind. The economy itself on the continent was breaking down. That’s why it didn’t matter if you caught the disease or not, this was no different from everyone rushing straight to hell.

Once my face turned blue, Ivar Lodbrok changed his tone to be serious.

“Us demons at least have better circumstances. Since, different from humans, we have studied black magic for hundreds and thousands of years. We have an understanding on how to handle diseases and keep the damage to a minimum. However, humans are different. They had banned black magic on a national degree. Thus, they are overwhelmingly lacking in experience and information. For them, not 30% but 40%. It could even possibly go up to 50%.”

“Oh, Lord. Goddesses……”

“The problem was how Lapis Lazuli had predicted this epidemic.”

Ivar Lodbrok took a pipe out from underneath his clothes.

He started to mutter while pressing tobacco into the chamber of his pipe.

“To know what the cure of the disease was and claim a monopoly on it. This was not a coincidence. There’s no doubt that this plague was made artificially.”

“Are you saying…… that someone had spread this disease on purpose?”

Ivar Lodbrok nodded.

But was that possible? Lapis Lazuli was merely a half-breed succubus. She did not have the ability to make this kind of disease on her own. No, there was no one on the entire continent that was capable of doing this.

As if he had read my mind, Ivar Lodbrok spoke.

“If you thought with common-sense, then it’s an impossible tale. However, if it was Demon Lord Barbatos, then it is possible.”

“Demon Lord Barbatos……”

Rank 8th Demon Lord.

She was known as the greatest necromancer on the continent and was also referred to as the Immortal Monarch.

The army that Demon Lord Barbatos led consisted entirely of 5,000 undeads. They were corpses that had died long ago. If it was Barbatos, the maestro of black magic and diseases, then she could have created a plague like this. Was what Ivar Lodbrok had concluded……

That meant that Lapis Lazuli was Barbatos’ pawn.

Dantalian was just the fake bait displayed at the front.
Was the true perpetrator Barbatos? Was that it. Was this the truth……

“This is not a baseless assumption. Demon Lord Barbatos has always despised humans. If there were to be an outbreak, then the damage on the human side will heavily outweigh the damage on the demons. This was obvious.”

Ivar Lodbrok continued to speak in a composed manner.

“Therefore, it wouldn’t be weird if Demon Lord Barbatos was aiming to exterminate the human race with an epidemic. It would be more appropriate to compliment that rational assumption.”

“……That is horrible.”

I now understood why Ivar Lodbrok had told me that it was going to be more horrible later.

To spread an epidemic just to simply get rid of a single race. Escaping all rationality, this was an unforgivable crime. The thought, ‘Could people actually become this villainous’ floated through my mind and gave me the urge to vomit.

“Demon Lords, in the end, are that kind of character. In order to make their dreams a reality, they do not care whether means are fair or foul. It has been like this for thousands of years.”

“……Should we be standing here without a word? While millions of people cry out in agony, Barbatos, Dantalian, and Lapis Lazuli are in cahoots. Retaliation is required.”

“I share that opinion. Torukel. Look at this.”

Ivar Lodbrok flicked his finger.

A certain scroll on his desk lifted up in mid-air and flew towards me. Receiving the scroll, I spread it out left and right.

On the parchment, it was written that in one months time all the Demon Lords were to gather together to hold a meeting. It was called Walpurgis Night.

The location, Niflheim— as it so happens, it was the city our Keuncuska Firm headquarter was located in. It was okay to look at this as a golden opportunity.

“Keruk. It’s the big meeting that only happens every several years.”

“It is most likely to create a countermeasure for the plague. Demon Lord Dantalian will also be attending. Ten to one, that little succubus will come along with him. We will end those two there.”

But.

Under the assumption that Demon Lord Barbatos was the true culprit, we still had no proof. However, if we threatened either Dantalian or Lapis Lazuli and then tortured them, then we’d be able to gain whatever evidence we required.

“Tell me what I should do, Lodbrok.”

Especially Lapis Lazuli. This girl, I could not forgive.

Despite the fact that we had summoned her, Lapis Lazuli had not responded. Contact itself was cut off. There was no other choice but to see this as a clear betrayal to the firm.

For her to forget about the grace we had provided for her by taking her in.

A punishment must be ordered at once.

“For now, I will get in contact with Dantalian. Torukel. You go to her highness Paimon and make a request.”

“……To her highness Paimon?”

“The culprit is Barbatos. Only her highness Paimon could face against her.”

I nodded my head.

It was renowned that Barbatos and her highness Paimon were on bad terms. If it meant to get a free hit on Barbatos, then her highness Paimon would not refuse.

Oh, great Keuncuska.

You shall repay blood with blood.

TL note: Aaaaaah finished!

I honestly didn’t expect for this part to take that long. I  thought I’d be able to finish this in one day, but apparently I was mistaken! This part had so many explaining parts that it took me a lot longer to edit. I was also going to upload this last night but I passed out writing this TL note!
I got like super enthusiastic to write this part because the last parts of a chapter was always exciting. Albeit, once I got drained mentally, I slowed down.

Oh, I also found a mistake that I had been making about Ivar Lodbrok. I thought he was an ancient vampire, but he was actually one of the three Draculas that were alive. So a pure blood. I’ll be fixing that mistake.

I’m very grateful to all the positive response this story has been getting and I look forward to bringing you guys more! (Albeit, that three 1 star vote on novelupdate poked me) Tell your friends and family of this story! Well, probably not your family, unless you have a sibling that’s also interested in light novels. Other than that, they might just give you sympathy nods.

Update schedule: I responded to someone in the comments about how I planned to update. If you didn’t see it, don’t worry since I’ll be putting it here as well.
For now, I plan to release at least 2 chapters a week. On what day I upload will depend on the length of the chapter (and my enthusiasm level). Once I finish this volume, I will most likely take a short break, since I myself had not finished reading volume 2 yet. Translating and reading at the same time won’t really let me fully enjoy the story, so yeah. Give me about a week after volume 1 is over to finish reading volume 2. This will be the same with volume 3. BECAUSE VOLUME THREE WAS ANNOUNCED EARLIER THIS WEEK. HYYYYYPEEEEE.
Ehem.
Anyways, apologies beforehand!

Oh dear, I reached the 10k word mark with this TL note…

?

To leave one’s home only leads to trouble.

I declare that that sentence was the truth.

Traditionally, people gained life lessons from biographies of great people.

The one truth I was able to discover from swimming through the history of mankind from time immemorial, was that every incident to ever happen was outside one’s home.

The reason Buddha went through such hardship was because he had run away from home. The reason Caesar was assassinated was because he had uselessly wandered around outside.

The most memorable death was that of philosopher René Descartes. This man originally spent his time taking naps, however, his superior had suddenly ordered him to ‘come to work by 5am’, and thus resulted in René Descartes dying of overwork. After learning of such historical tragedy, I had come to a conclusion at a young age: Never go outside. Then your safety will be certain.

History scholars would probably gladly give a standing ovation to such a brilliant solution. My name would be forever remembered as the advocate of theory in the history books.

But, I couldn’t be happy.

The world was overflowing with people who begrudged geniuses. It may be possible to impress the history scholars, but to receive the admiration of the public was incredibly difficult. Recently, I had been experiencing my mornings gloomily, like a genius being tragically eaten alive by the jealously and envy of the people……

“Your highness Dantalian.”

The culprit to create this tragedy was Lapis Lazuli.

Ironically, she was my first vassal.

“It is already 11am. Please wake up.”

“Mm, mmm…… is 11am not still the crack of dawn……?”

“This one does not know where to raise an argument first. If this one had to point out one thing then it is that 11am absolutely is not dawn.”

Lapis Lazuli spoke calmly.

This inflexible succubus, representing the people, did her utmost to interfere with my shut-in life. I think she had mistaken that doing so was her duty by fate.

I groaned as if I was a politician being assaulted by the nasty media.

“Who, with what right, said that 11am is not dawn……?”

“Sound common sense decided so.”

I pulled my blanket over my head.

To want to take me away from this comfortable feeling. If this wasn’t an unimaginable violence, then I didn’t know what it was. Not only was that succubus’ period getting worse, but there was a loose screw in her head, I was certain.

“Most people have a mental sickness. Common sense is nothing more than rules that those mentally ill people had arranged on their own. Therefore, rules for a mental hospital. As a unique sane individual, such as myself, I shall not fall to the pressure of those psychopaths……”

“Haa. Your highness has been sleeping for 22 hours now.”

Show some moderation and get up.

Was the small warning I could hear from her voice.

I hugged my pillow even tighter, displaying my will to resist desperately.

“Stop thinking so firmly. The world won’t come to an end. And since it isn’t, then it’s better off getting in 10 more minutes of sleep.”

“…… Did your highness mention the end of the world just for 10 more minutes of sleep? This one cannot help but be amazed by your highness’ extraordinary leap in logic.”

Lapis Lazuli spoke as if she was dumbfounded.

“It is a conceptual shift. I live life to the fullest everyday as if it was my last. In short, I do my very best to be lazy.”

“This one had never imagined that the word lazy and the word best had such a close relation to one another. No matter how much this one looked, your highness’ use of words is always marvelous.”

Tack

The sound of a finger snapping could be heard over my blanket.

The moment after, my blanket started to move restlessly and then rose up by itself. It was magic. I hurriedly reached up and tried to at least grab the edge of my blanket, but it was in vain.

“Ah, aah! Wait!”

“Please sleep moderately.  There is no need to sleep excessively in one’s life. Even if one were to die, then wouldn’t they be able to sleep for all of eternity in their grave?”

The blanket was sent flying across the entire room.

I glared fiercely at Lapis Lazuli.

“Magic is cheating!”

“This one had thought that your highness loved cheating.”

“The only one allowed to cheat in this world is me. It’s only appropriate for everyone else to live life being fair and square. That way I’ll be able to gain profit whenever I want, is that not right!?”

“By the looks of it, it seems that this one might have chosen the wrong lord to serve……”

Lapis Lazuli let out a small sigh.

“Your highness. The Walpurgis Night will be held on the day after tomorrow. If we do not depart now, then we may end up not being able to attend the meeting.”

“Not attend. That’s good. Not attend. Truthfully, that has a beautiful ring to it.”

“You cannot. If your highness Dantalian is absent from the plague countermeasure meeting, while being in possession of a mass amount of the cure, then your highness will receive heavy criticism and be berated. If it means to protect your highness’ honor, then this one is prepared to use drastic measures.”

“Hou. You’re coming on rather strong.”

I snorted.

“Sorry, but I don’t have parents or a family, nor do I even have a childhood friend that was separated from me at a young age. In other words, I’m the absolute strongest! How you plan to bring down I, Demon Lord Dantalian, when he doesn’t have a single weakness, is something I wish to see. Go ahead, use that drastic measure that you seem to be so proud of.”

“Yes. Then as this one is ordered to.”

Taack

Lapis Lazuli snapped her finger again.

The pillow that was held tightly between my arms had smoothly slipped out of my grasp.

“Nooooooooo!?”

“Then. This one has done as your highness has commanded.”

“Why are you slyly lifting your chin up proudly!? Return my pillow immediately! That is not a simple pillow! That is my soul. That is a part of my soul!”

“My apologies.”

It was then, with a ‘poof’, the pillow exploded.

White feathers rained down.

“My pretty soul—!?” (TL note: He says this in English)

I screamed.

Like a hero who had just lost his childhood friend(engaged • 2 months pregnant) that was a mage to the Demon Lord, my body shook violently.

“The soul has died.”

“You Devil!”

“It is fine to call this one a Devil. With Devil like ways, this one shall make your highness get up. Even if your highness was to punish this one, this one shall remain loyal till the very end.”

“Why is your side the one being conceited!? Have our positions not switched!?”

“Apologies. Since this one is, in reality, quite the distinguished subject to your lord.”

“It sounds like you’re repenting but it actually sounds annoying……!?”

“It has been one month since this one has been appointed to your highness Dantalian. During that short period of time, this one had met with no more than 72 firms and sold the cure to the disease. In order to purposely sell the black herb at a high price, this one had released the supply slowly, thus allowing this one to sell the herb for an extraordinary price of 10 gold a piece. Due to this, there is a total of 500,000 Libra in your highness’ vault. There are still over 25,000 herbs that we have yet to sell. This trade, with no doubt, will go down in history.” (TL note: The author made a mistake here. 10 x 5000 = 50,000, so he actually has 50,000 libra in his vault. The mistake is fixed later by the author)

“You really are distinguished……!?”

“That is so. One could say that this one was on a different dimension to your highness, who had spent the past month philandering with a pillow.”

I thought it was more impressive in another meaning that Lapis Lazuli could speak from start to finish with a completely stoic face. Really.

If I recalled correctly, in <Dungeon Attack>, the annual income of the Imperials in the Habsburg Empire was 500,000 gold. Lapis Lazuli was able to earn an amount similar to that in only a month.

Honestly, I admitted that she had an enormous ability.

If she had not interfered with my sleep, then I would have even patted her head.

However, she had not only plundered me of my blanket, but she had destroyed my pillow as well— Lapis Lazuli had done something irreparable and had crossed the Rubicon River.

Compromise was impossible.

I, as a proud member of the Roman Res Republica elder council, sincerely despised the tyrant that didn’t know his place and was trying to become a dictator. It’d be a good idea to celebrate your victory now, Julius Caesar. In the end, you will be stabbed in the back by the child you thought was kind and gentle……

“…… What should I do. Just because I had destroyed a pillow, the man whom I had sworn to serve as my lord is glaring at me as if I was a sworn enemy. Before being troubled, I feel more shocked.”

“Lala.”

I warned her seriously.

“It is fine to use my name in order to gain authority. It is also fine to fill your back pockets as you earn money. There is one thing. Regardless of all that…… it is absolutely unforgivable to treat my pillow with contempt! Do you understand? This is a strict order!”

Lapis Lazuli looked at me.

She had the eyes of a person looking at unrecyclable industrial waste.

Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 8, Day 15
Dantalian’s Demon Lord Castle

I was able to drag his highness outside.

According to his highness Dantalian, it has been four months since he had last gone out. Ever since Riff’s adventurer group had invaded, he had shut himself in the cave.

By any chance, was his highness Dantalian not a Demon Lord but a vampire? I could believe this kind of nonsense right now. One could only be astonished by his highness’ laziness.

“T-The sun, it’s too strong……!”

As soon as we had left the cave, his highness screamed.

Covering his face with his arms, he sunk to the floor. …… Are you a ghoul? Are you the type of undead whose flesh melted when under the sun?

What was worse was that it wasn’t even the afternoon. It was the evening. The beautiful glow of the setting sun was floating in the sky. Even ghouls with rotten innards would move around energetically during this time of the day. As soon as I had pointed that fact out to his highness, his highness gave me a serious look.

“How ignorant. Originally, people as weary of life as I am find even the setting sun to be blinding and overwhelming.”

“That speech may be nice, but the actions done by your highness are the worst.”

I still can’t believe it that well.

Was this lazy man truly ‘the’ Dantalian that had vastly toyed with the Keuncuska Firm? It wasn’t some mistake, right?

A sigh drifted out of my mouth. That was the 21st sigh today. I should be cautious to not let this become a habit.

“……Originally, using teleportation magic would be the fastest method of transportation. However, because of the plague outbreak, all cities have placed a ban on teleportation. We will be using a different method.”

“How splendid. To be quickly trying to put countermeasures for the disease, that shows how competent the city management are. I give them my respect. And in that sense, I shall wait patiently for the ban to be lifted.”

His highness turned his back and tried to move towards the cave entrance.

However, without being able to take two steps, he stopped. I had grabbed hold of his highness’ cloak beforehand.

“This one will never let your highness go.”

“Damned forever-on-her-period succubus.”

“It does not matter if your highness swears at this one. Does your highness know how many hours it took to drag your highness all the way here?”

“Uuuuh……”

“It does not matter if your highness makes a pitiable face as well. In the first place, a pitiful expression does not fit your highness. Please restrain yourself from ever doing so again since there is the danger that it will cause the on-looking party to vomit.”

“You really are excessively honest!?”

I pulled out a pocket watch and checked the time.

Since teleportation magic wasn’t possible, I had called witches.

The Berbere sisters. They were one of the 5 talented groups in the demon world. Although, in this day and age, broom travel had become an antique due to teleportation magic, there was no other choice. You had to make do with what you could get……

“They should be arriving soon.”

The pocket watch pointed towards 11 hours and 55 minutes.

This clock interlocked with the other party’s pocket watch. It displayed when the other party would arrive. This was an essential magical tool for busy merchants.

The starting point was 12 o’clock on the dot. The further they were from your location, the time would change accordingly. If it was 11:55 then it meant that they were 5 minutes away. The witches were going to arrive within 5 minutes.

And sure enough.

The sound of a song could be heard. It felt like it came from the sky, but it also felt like it was coming from across the forest that was spread out in front of the cave.

 

“A dream world, we drift into the magical sky.
Spin, all and everything will spin.
The planets will spin, the shooting stars will spin, everything will spin.
Hand in hand, us witches will also spin.
You thrice, I thrice, once more we spin thrice.
Get along and add it together and we’d have spun three hundred thirty-three times.”

 

The chorus grew closer.

At first, it appeared like winter geese were flying across the sky. Except, they were too large to be called geese. In truth, the wings were a cape, and the beak was a broom.

Taak

12 witches landed gracefully.

All of the witches, in perfect sync, knelt down.

“Sacred and inviolable representative that symbolizes absolute dignity, one of the 72 lords that commands an army of demons.”

Amongst them, the witch that seemed to be the leader spoke.

It was a girl with short trimmed pale blonde hair.

“It is more than an honor to be allowed in your highness’ presence.”

“May the Goddess Hecate’s blessing be upon you all. Raise your heads.”

His highness Dantalian responded as per courtesy.

“We will be in your care for the time being. Do take care of us as much as you can.”

His face was serious. You couldn’t even see a trace of the person who was childishly screaming about how the sun was blinding him earlier. No matter who saw, you could only see a solemn and noble Demon Lord, that was it.
……I consider that cheating.

“Yes, great lord. Us Berbere sisters will do our utmost to provide your lordship a comfortable and relaxing trip!

The witch in charge responded energetically.

She probably had not noticed his highness Dantalian’s true form to even the slightest amount. Her face was glowing with the self-pride that she was able to serve a Demon Lord. That pureness was enviable……

While drawing magic circles on the ground, the witches prepared for the travel busily. Their brimmed cone hats were so big that it covered more than 2/3 of their heads. It was cute.

His highness Dantalian suddenly whispered in my ear.

“Lala. Are the witches not excessively young?”

“…… Too close. Your highness, please move away.”

“Ah. Sorry about that.”

It was troubling that his highness would get so close to me at times.

Has he forgotten that I was an outcast?

Luckily, the witches did not know of my status. Regardless, just the fact that I had whispered with his highness alone was good grounds for a large problem to occur. Demon Lords were sacred and inviolable representatives that symbolized absolute dignity. For me, who used to be a mere peasant, the very action of even conversing with his highness should be impossible. What could he be possibly thinking……

I sighed and— Oh dear, that was the 22nd sigh—

I straightened my posture.

“Do not judge witches by their outer appearance. Once witches make a life contract with a Demon Lord, all of their bodily growth stops for eternity. If they appear young, then it meant that they were that talented of an individual and were scouted at a young age.”

“Ho.”

It was so.

In the world of witches, the young did not respect the elderly. It was the complete opposite. The old worshiped the youth. It’d be better to say ‘respect the young’, instead of ‘respect the elderly’.

All members of the Berbere sisters had the face of young girls. It meant that they were all immensely talented individuals. In addition to that, on their chest was a three-leaf badge. A triphyllous badge. Thus meaning that they had participated in the Viet war 3 times. Due to the racial division method, the witches would have been on the front lines of the air battles, which was known to have the highest casualty rate. They were the elite of elites.

I wonder if the preparations had all finished. The leader girl was hopping her way over to us. She was most likely at least 200 years older than I was, and yet, I wonder why she appeared to be so cute…… It was an incomprehensible mystery.

“Great lord! Great lord! Please sign here!”

The lead witch courteously held out a parchment.

“Us Berbere sisters transparently disclose our travel fees to all of our customers. No matter what happens, we do not ask for additional payments later on!”

The witch, as if she was very proud, broadened her shoulders.

“……”

On the other hand, the complexion of his highness Dantalian, as he was looking down at the parchment, was boundlessly dark. What could possibly be written on it that would make him like that. I took a glance over his shoulder.

    Berbere Witch Sisters

    We shall always treat out customers honestly and kindly

    *Wind protection magic: Only 2 gold

    *Temperture control magic: Only 1 gold

    *Sound control magic: Small sum of 4 silver

    *Beautiful singing and fantastical scenery magic: Only 1 gold

    *Hot honey wine that can melt your insides: Small sum of 2 silver

    *Each escort: Only 3 gold x 12 people = 36 gold

Hm.

It felt a bit expensive, but it was still within the permissible range. We were hiring 12 witches who all had a triphyllous badge. Even if we were paying a somewhat large amount, it was okay.

“Hehe. We calculated the price after thoroughly checking the current market.”

The lead witch must be confident too. She was smiling cheerfully.

“In total it is 41 gold and 1 silver. In the honor and glory of being able to attend your great lordship, we ‘ll just shave that 1 silver off. 41 gold coins. Aha, if it’s this then it’s almost nothing!”

“…………”

Huh?

The edge of his highness’ mouth had become stiff.

It was barely enough that only I had noticed it. I couldn’t figure out why he was like this.

Surely, the person who had made more than 50,000 gold from selling the cure to the disease wouldn’t be stingy about this amount of money. A few days ago he had even wasted 1,600 gold on buying a useless ring……

“Could you wait a moment. I have something I must discuss with my vassal.”

His highness Dantalian put the witches behind him. Then, as if he was going to whisper into my ear again, he lowered his head. At this point, I don’t feel like warning him anymore.

“What is it, your highness.”

“Why does it cost 41 gold just to get a lift on a broom once? This is a rip-off. This is a rip-off for sure!”

For a moment, I was speechless.

To have really been stingy about the money.

“…… Excuse this one, but that is a fitting, and thus appropriate, employment fee. Please consider the fact that this is not only a transportation fee, but an escort fee as well. 12 of the most elite witches. Even if we were to be assaulted by injustice during the flight, they will easily be able to repel the threat.”

“Damn, shit. My blood like money……”

With shaking hands, his highness Dantalian opened his money pouch.

It was strange.

Due to my curiosity I couldn’t help but ask him.

“Your highness. Why is your highness grinding your teeth over some gold coins? There’s 50,000 Libra stored in the vault. And there’s still 25,000 herbs left to be sold. Also, did your highness not readily spend 1,600 gold coins on something recently.”

“Do you really not understand?”

His highness Dantalian glared at me.

His voice was immensely serious. It was the tone he used when he was not being a lazy bum but a cruel level-headed schemer.

I automatically became nervous. Was there perhaps something that I had missed?

His highness opened his lips.

“Does the decrease of my money not mean the less time I’d be able to play at my leisure and not work?”

“……eh?”

I’m sorry.

I couldn’t hear him correctly.

“If I were to go into the cave and swing a pickax all day, then I’d earn 1 silver. If I were to try to earn 41 gold, then that meant I’d have to mine for 205 days. 205 days of playing all gone due to one trip!”

“……”

“Now. Do you understand why I’m being a miser? The ring assisted in providing a comfortable life for myself, so I had held back tears and bought it. How could some trip compare to that!”

“……”

It was for a single moment, but.

His highness Dantalian looked like a larva that was infesting rotten food.

Was it truly a good idea to serve his highness as a vassal?

I started to lose confidence in my own decision.

Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 8, Day 16
Niflheim, Hermes’ Plaza

The flight took 8 hours.

Honestly, it was no different to torture. Once again, I missed the scientific advancements of my original world.

To sit behind a witch on a broom. In words it sounded simple, but this hurt my buttocks tremendously. After arriving in Niflheim I couldn’t stand properly for fair amount of time. For this kind of trip to be 41 gold. I wanted to demand a refund immediately.

“Well done everyone. I was considering buying you all a beer for delivering us here safely, would that be okay?”

To keep a good face on even in this situation, was the bastard so-called social life. Was it not horrible? Was it not even more horrible that the witches had cheered “Thank you very much!” at my offer?

We know a good place, the witches said and guided us there.

The place was a plaza. At the edge of the large plaza, many pubs and bars were lined up together. Even at a slight glance, you could see over 200 customers seated outside and drinking beer. It seemed like all of the bars shared the seats outside.

“This is the Temple of Hermes Plaza. It is Niflheim’s main tourist attraction. It is also the only place you can drink beer without having to worry about one’s race and social status.”

The witch chatted pleasantly.

“This place has taken the name of the Temple of Hermes that was in ruins here. Can your lord see the wreckage over there? That is a vestige of the temple.”

“It seems to have been preserved because of some historical value.”

“Ahaha, my apologies but that is not so.  12 years ago a group fight erupted. A bunch of dumb trolls and minotaurs got drunk and started a big fight. Because of that everything became completely devastated. The very next day, the governor of Niflheim created a law that stated, murder that occurs in a table with more than 7 people gathered, while being drunk, will be declared as innocent. Well, in other words, it was basically telling people, ‘next time you get drunk and decide to start a ruckus, we’re not even going to find the culprit for you, so take care of yourself’.”

“…… That is a surprisingly novel law.”

“Our governor is a bit passionate.”

The witch nodded.

“In a serious sense, you could say the governor is a person who can display ingenuity. The ruins being left here like so is meant to be a warning.”

“Don’t mess around?”

“Something like that—”

We went to whatever seat was nearby and sat down.

A palm sized fairy flew over to take our orders. It felt like the fairy was terrified of the witches as they weren’t able to lift their head as smoothly as they did earlier. Witches may have been treated as slaves with their souls taken by Demon Lords, but they also had an incredible power so they couldn’t be treated lightly.

Shortly after, fairies in a line formation air lifted our beers to us. We each took a glass and lifted it up.

“You all did a good job today. Despite being attacked by sirens mid-flight, you were able to repel them swiftly. I shall praise that. We were able to arrive here safely all thanks to you sisters. I’d like to make a toast to the Berbere sisters.”

“”The Berbere sisters!””

Clang

The beer glasses made a satisfying clanging sound as they hit one another.

The drinking party progressed merrily.

After finding out that Shakespeare was never born in this world, I immediately went into an impromptu one-man play of <Macbeth> and <Romeo and Juliet>.

Reciting the lines from start to finish like I did in elementary school was probably difficult to do at this point. But it was easy to put in a decent amount of dramatic effect as I told the story. The witches became entranced as I performed with a face full of sorrow.

……

“……Finally, Juliet took Romeo’s hand in her own. A cold hand. There was warmth, but the heat was slowly draining away. Juliet, wanting to feel even the smallest amount of that warmth, placed the back of her lover’s hand against her cheek……”

“”……””

All 12 witches were with bated breaths.

Lapis Lazuli appeared to be composed while holding her beer glass, however, that glass had been empty for quite a while now. Even Lapis Lazuli had been captivated by my improvised play.

“However, the back of that hand had soon become cold as well. Juliet shed a tear. Aah, where has my lover gone? Why is his body so cold? Desperately, to feel even the smallest amount of warmth, Juliet searched through Romeo’s body.…… but alas, she could no longer find the warmth of her beloved which she had longed for. Aah, Romeo, oh sweet Romeo. I can no longer feel your warmth……”

“Uh, aah.”

Tears were starting to brim in the witches’ eyes.

If you looked around, it wasn’t only our table that was quiet, but the other seats around us were strangely silent as well. I could sense that other people had turned their ears to me.

I was certain. I was grabbing hold of the hearts of approximately 30 people.

Modern people already knew full well of the story of <Romeo and Juliet>, thus they weren’t able to get into the story with a fresh feeling. However, these people were different. It was the first time for these people of the demon world to ever hear such an intense love story. Of course, the immersion level would be different if you compared the two.

Forbidden romance was always a popular theme.

I drew out a mournful voice.

“Oh, but what was this? Reaching the end of final moments, Juliet was able to discover a place of warmth from her lover. The lips. There was still a faint feeling of warmth drifting from his mouth. Shedding tears, Juliet pressed her lips against her lover’s. There was nothing more warm…… more tender…… more soft. But, Juliet knew. That the tenderness of her lover’s lips too, will fade away like a midsummer night’s dream.”

I paused.

A terrified stillness reigned over the drinking party.

At the highest zenith.

After looking at the tears falling from the witches, while pleasantly on the inside, but with a tragic tone on the outside, I continued.

“Juliet muttered. If this was so, then take action before the warmth has faded. Before witnessing the death of my lover, cover a death with another…… Juliet held up Romeo’s dagger.”

“Aah, aaah!”

The witches covered their mouths with their hands.

They had finally realized the ending of the story.

Their eyes were filled with shock.

“Juliet shouted. Oh dagger, it is nice to see you. My heart shall be your sheath! ……and Juliet stabbed the dagger deep into her own chest.”

“Ah, aah!”

The witches had eventually embraced each other.

Mm.

I was incredibly pleased.

To be able to control people’s emotions with my acting ability. To make them feel sad, happy, hope, and despair, this was what truly gave me a reason to live. The stress that had piled up during our flight here melted like an ice under the sun.

My second half little sister had heavily criticised me about this before, saying that this was a perverted preference.

I couldn’t really understand her.

I was only gifting people with pleasure for free.

Look carefully. The witches were not able to handle the tragedy and were shuddering, Lapis Lazuli may have still been expressionless, but she was holding onto her glass tightly, and even the drinkers around us were letting out groans. Was this not a beautiful and harmonious scene?

That was why, I shall make them happier.

While grinning on the inside, I spoke.

“Blood flowed from Juliet’s chest. She could feel her own blood. Juliet’s vision started to fade……”

“N-No.”

Someone had faintly emitted a moan.

How could they react so purely.

Truthfully, it felt worthwhile teasing, no, I mean, being of service to them.

“……Finally. Juliet pressed her face against Romeo’s body. Her lover’s body was immensely warm. In truth, it was because of the blood flowing from Juliet. However, Juliet, who had already lost all her senses, could only feel it as the tenderness coming from her lover’s body……  A blessing as it was a tragedy. A tragedy as it was a blessing…… Juliet smiled faintly. At last, submerged in her own blood. With her face lied on top of her beloved’s body. Slowly, ever so slowly…… her soft eyes closed.”

Close curtain.

END.

……

A moment of silence.

“”Juliet is so pitiful—!””

The witches shouted together.

The ending without any hopes or dreams had impacted heavily onto their consciousness. The twelve of them immediately started to voice their complaints.

“It can’t be! That can’t happen!”

“Waaah, waaah……”

“Lord, great lord! The two become happy in the end, right? Some amazing warlock appears with a ‘tadah!’ and revives Romeo and Juliet, right!?”

I felt gleeful by their fervent cries.

Thank you for responding so fervidly, audience.

But the one thing I loved most in the world was showing people, who were chanting for a happy ending, the cruel truth of the hopeless reality.

“Sadly……that kind of luck never befell those two.”

“S-Surely?”

“Yes.”

I nodded.

The witches had miserable expressions on their faces, as if they were just told the news by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, that sea otters were on the brink of extinction.

I smiled.

“Romeo and Juliet, without being able to be revived, died forever.”

“Huaaaaaaang!”

The witches lamented at the top of their lungs.

Right now, a scar that would last forever had appeared on their hearts.

I believed that scars made people grow. In short, by providing them with this single scar, I was also presenting them a stepping stone to grow as an individual. In the distant future, these witches will probably look into the past and thank me. That thanks to his highness Dantalian’s deep consideration, they were able to mature further as a person……

The results of my education took effect rather quickly.

 

[Your devilish performance has captivated the people!]

[Witch Humbaba’s affection went up by 11.]

[Witch Stheno’s affection went up by 12.]

[Witch Euryale’s affection went up by 9.]

 

A large amount of notice windows came pouring down.

Excluding one witch, the affection rate went up for all of them by an incredible amount. There was no doubt. The witches had been deeply moved by my romance stories. As evidence, they kept shedding warm tears.

“Lady Macbeth, Juliet they……”

“There’re only dirty travesties in the world……”

“I’m not going to believe in something like religion now……”

Was this not amazing?

This gloomy color of despair was a color that befitted people.

Like a religious sect leader for a new religion, I was looking down at the young lambs with satisfaction. That was it. Throw away your hopes for the outside world and shut yourself inside. That way everything will be alright.

Lapis Lazuli, who was seated beside me, let out a sigh.

“This one must admit, your highness is the same as ever.”

“I know. Consistently being this refreshing is my charm.”

“This one thinks that your highness consistently being rotten to the core is a fault.”

“Hoo, that’s why the jealousy of a dull-witted mind is quite vulgar.”

I raised the corners of my mouth.

Lapis Lazuli was looking at me with dead eyes.

It was fine. Her expression may have been like that, but inside, she as well had been moved by my eloquence. It probably wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that she was captivated. It was just that she was embarrassed to display her inner feelings……

 

[Lapis Lazuli’s affection went down by 1.]

 

I was wrong.

Lapis Lazuli was much further from being two-faced.

Be it shyness or embarrassment, these kinds of squishy emotions never existed in this impervious succubus in the first place.

“Hm hm. This time a bit more brighter story……”

“Ooi! The reception is completely terrible!”

It was at the moment I had cleared my throat to change the topic.

On the other side of the plaza came a crashing sound, followed by a noisy racket. Our group, as if we had promised to do so previously, turned our gaze together towards that location.

“The alcohol tastes terrible, and the seats are hard! You don’t even have any common courtesy towards your customers! To want to receive payment with this, are you actually trying to do business!?”

“My apologies. My sincere apologies, your highness.”

A young’un was shouting at an old dwarf.

The dwarf’s face was covered in wrinkles. His clothes were rather decent. He was most likely the owner of one of the bars. The dwarf was on the ground and bowing his head over and over again.

“Because our lowly employees were unable to recognize your highness……”

“Ha. That’s why every old bastard should just die.”

Smack

The young man had kicked the flank of the old dwarf.

The old man let out a shout and fell over.

“To try to do business when there’s mold in your brain!”

Kick.

“Look at your entertainment, it’s pathetic!”

Another kick.

Irrational violence was taking place in public.

The atmosphere in the plaza became cold. However, there was not even a single person that tried to stop it. As if everyone had made a silent agreement to stay out of the violence that was happening before them.

The taste of alcohol quickly vanished. The tipsy state I was in for drinking beer had steadily cooled off. It wasn’t a good type of cool feeling, but an unpleasant coolness.

“Who is that laughable man?”

“Rank 72nd Demon Lord, Andromalius.”

Lapis Lazuli whispered.

“Demon Lord?”

I narrowed my brows.

Now that I looked carefully, I could see a small horn on that man’s forehead.

The horn on the back of my head was small enough to be nearly covered by my hair, but that man’s horn was even less than that. If I did not know he was a Demon Lord, I would have mistaken it for some large pimple.

“Yes. Andromalius spends most of his time in the Niflheim casino throughout the entire year. He is famous for using his title as a Demon Lord to torment the people.”

“So he’s like the neighborhood bully.”

I sneered.

Demon Lord Andromalius appeared in the game so I knew well about him.

If Dantalian was the practice boss, then he was the tutorial boss. He was a small-fry that pitifully gets killed by the level 1 hero.

Misery loved company.

Whether it was Andromalius or Dantalian, we were both on the level of being treated like a rice fish, so it would be a good idea if we were to support each other, but——
There was a severe difference between me and this wastrel.

 

Demon Lord Andromalius ‘awakens’ the hero.

 

In the prologue, the protagonist is assaulted by demons.

Except the protagonist, the townspeople and his entire family end up dying. If you chose to play as a male character, then your little sister. If you chose to play as a female character, then your big brother is sacrificed.

No matter what side, the protagonist loses someone important to him. Thus, burning with the desire for revenge, he vows ‘I will kill every last single Demon Lord on this continent.’……

“Hmm.”

The culprit that gives birth to the monster known as the hero.

That was the future that lied ahead for that man across the plaza who was abusing that old man.

The current year was 1505 on the Empire calendar. The year that the hero’s village gets attacked was 1506 on the Empire calendar.

It would by all means only be appropriate to do something before this year has passed. If not, then it meant that some kid in a mountain valley will suddenly awaken as a hero. Getting rid of a variable like the hero early on would be a sensible decision if I wanted to continue living the remainder of my life peacefully and lazily.

It was then.

With a ‘tirring’, an alarm rang and windows rose up.

The choices were as if they were bringing out my inner thoughts.

 

[1. Become friendly with Andromalius.]

[2. Murder Andromalius.]

 

I placed a hand on my chin.

…… Yes. The first choice was favorable.

After becoming friendly with Andromalius, I would induce him to more thoroughly attack the hero’s village. Eliminate the source of the problem. The tactic of getting rid of the dangerous sprout in advance was always valid.

On the other hand, the second choice was radical.

To kill Andromalius and thus ridding the cause of the problem entirely, the direction of that plan itself was not wrong. The problem was the ripple effect.

‘ A Demon Lord has murdered another Demon Lord.’

Due to such an incident, people would gather their attention onto me. People’s gazes would uselessly be focused on myself. As a solution, this caused too much commotion.

I preferred dealing with problems a bit more quietly. Such as assassination. That side was more to my preference. However, I didn’t even know where to hire an assassin…… Did I have to select number 1?

Looking at the cold atmosphere enveloping the plaza, I could tell that Andromalius had no popularity. The demon races here seemed to despise that lecher. It was a problem. If I were to get on friendly terms with Andromalius here, then my own image would fall as well. Reputation was like the life line of politicians. If possible, I wanted to keep that as clean as possible.

But, was any choice besides 1 attainable? To murder Andromalius and also avoid receiving attention. Could I make such an ideal result happen……? It was impossible to completely avoid the attention. But if I was able to shift the gaze to somewhere else……

“Your highness?”

Lapis Lazuli’s voice brought me out from my thoughts.

I swiftly turned my head.

“Lala. Do you still have the ring on you right now?”

“Yes?…… this one does have it on for now.”

“Let me confirm it real quick.”

Without any warning, I grabbed Lapis Lazuli’s left hand. I could feel a small bump over her white glove.

There was a ring on her annular finger.

Publicly, Lapis Lazuli was known as my concubine.

Demon Lord Dantalian had fallen for his half-breed lover so much, that he didn’t turn to political affairs. That kind of rumor. Of course, it was nothing more than a wild rumor that we had made on purpose.

The ring was bought in order to further flesh out that distorted rumor. A few days ago, I had spent 1,600 gold to purchase two luxurious rings.

They were a pair of couple rings with a 5 carat azure colored diamond embedded into each of them. There were writings on the back written in Frankish. ‘I do not desire anyone but you(AUTRE NE VUEIL).’

In other words, a typical engagement vow.

In the public eye, Demon Lord Dantalian was the world’s biggest fool. A simpleton who had bought a ring for his lover as soon as he had gained some money. But look at this now. It was good that I had prepared this beforehand. A use for the ring has already appeared. No matter when, an ounce of prevention was worth a pound of cure……

“Don’t think you’ll ever be able to do business in this neighborhood ever again, you old fart! You piece of moldy trash.”

Andromalius was still abusing that old man.

There was an evil smile on that guy’s face. It seemed he quite enjoyed beating people up. That naive complexion was enviable.

Regardless, playing by yourself will quickly get boring, Andromalius. Please do let me partake in your fun activities.

Do not worry. I have a knack for making drinking parties delightful. A mere moment ago, with my ornate eloquence, I was able to petrify the witches. You too, will soon be flailing on the floor convulsing with laughter. I shall make you into an amazing supporting character to a romance story.

Finally, I confirmed with Lapis Lazuli.

“Lazuli. Does Andromalius have a group that is protecting him?”

“As far as this one knows, there are none.”

“Is there another Demon Lord he is peculiarly friendly with?”

“There are none. Even amongst Demon Lords, Andromalius is treated as a disgraceful failure.”

“Splendid.”

In other words, I had nothing to worry about.

I raised my beer glass.

One. Two. Three.

After counting down in my mind, I dropped the glass—

TL note: I’d like to give my thanks to all of you who are leaving such a positive response to Dungeon Defense! I honestly didn’t expect it to get this popular in such a short amount of time. After doing some calculations, I should be finished with volume 1 by the end of this month.
Although, I should say Chapter 4 of Volume 1 is more of a set up chapter for Chapter 5. So if you feel like the excitement is gone, then look forward to Chapter 5! Here’s a little spoiler, there are 5 illustrations in Chapter 5 alone! (Hence why there are none in this chapter)
There’s also another thing I should point out, one of Lapis Lazuli’s title I had translated is set to ‘outcast’. However, the original translation should be ‘Untouchable’ or ‘Harijan’, but I felt like if I wrote that then no one would be able to understand it properly (Untouchability). That’s why I read through the wiki article and noticed they were also referred to as ‘outcasts’, so I said it as so. If this seems to bother anyone then I will change it.

Oh, another important thing. If you haven’t noticed already, I had put a discord link on the side of the page now. There seemed to be some people who didn’t really want to sign up to wordpress in order to comment, so I made a discord where you can easily log in with a temporary name to leave a comment there. I figured it’d also be a good idea since it’d allow people to discuss the story, talk with me, give each other recommendations on other good novels, and even bug me about when the next chapter is coming out. So feel free to drop by our discord group! Click here!
