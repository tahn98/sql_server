Second year high-school student attending the local Nakatsuhara high school.

My club is the archery club, my specialty is archery.

Grades are so-so, physical strength average.

Appearance, probably not so good yet not so bad.

Hobbies are somewhat otakuish, though my range is pretty big so I normally try out everything I can.

Interests that will not change are the bow and era dramas.

The good part in my life, the look of me utilizing the bow.

Though, I still think I have a normal profile.

To be in such a place is definitely not fitted for me.
A reddish-brown wasteland as far as the eye can see.

This looks like the places I have heard about in my classes.

In the day it would get hot, at night it would become chilling, those kind of places.

From the time I have been sent here I have already faced 2 nights.

I haven’t eating anything, yet for some strange reason I don’t feel hungry.

I have been told that in this otherworld I can display physical abilities that surpass human capability so maybe that is the reason why.

Ah… why am I in this kind of place?

Answer, the result of a prank by God.

I get it, I already get it.

I don’t know how many times I have asked and answered myself this question.

What should have been a normal day with nothing happening.

Being called by one of the Mikos, Tsukuyomi Mikoto, then being abducted by that weird goddess and after that here I am.

The first one gave me an impression of being a kind God, the later one God is one that I don’t even want to acknowledge.

So the later Goddess one, no, the existence worse than a bug threw me out to an unknown wasteland where not only people but even the presence of animals could not be sensed.

Really, I don’t understand anything.

In this situation with no belongings at all, I walked through the wide unchanging scenery of the wasteland all day.

Instead of kidnapping this was closer to murder.

No good, the more I think about that bitch the more depressed I get.

My surroundings are already pitch black.

There was the light of the stars but it was not suitable for walking.

Because this body had already gotten used to electric light, the darkness in this place instilled fear.

But even if I say so, sleeping is a no go.

I have been feeling drowsy but if I sleep deeply, dangerous things might approach me.

That I can’t see anything doesn’t mean there isn’t anything at all.

I am starting to feel that it wouldn’t be bad to follow what the Goddess said and encounter some orc or goblins.

A place where I can sleep peacefully. I didn’t think that such a place would be feel so important to me.

Tomorrow.

Tomorrow for sure.

I pray for a change to occur.

If possible, please let me have a conversation with someone.

I won’t even care about the looks, I also want to find food.

Ha… I hope morning can come soon.

An incredibly long night that can’t compare to when I watched anime on the net in my room to pass time.

Second day of living in the otherworld, the same as the first. Nothing happening.

In a shadow of a rock I rolled up my knees and waited for morning to come.

Continuing blindly on this vast wasteland and rocky hills.

A scenario that continues on and on.

When I was falling my eyes were filled with tears and I didn’t have room to look carefully at what was at the bottom.

Seriously? This situation.

This is already the third day you know?

It should be fine to have a change about now.

Since the time I had fallen, I had been walking forward without caring about day or night. Anyhow, a wide barren land. Before I noticed I am in the same place, kind of thing, for the sake of not happening I made signs in a part of the scenery and continued to walk on.

Even with that, the thing that I am already used to seeing in front of me, a conspicuously tall mountain, I felt it hadn’t gotten any closer. It may be an illusion, and many times I felt my heart would crumble.

After all, there was commendably no one here nothing here.

In a sense it was incredible. Not only people, there aren’t even animals you know?

Ah, I had forgotten it.

Things I could eat there were none you see. I in times saw a dry straw like grass, as expected, I don’t think I would be able to eat it. But even that is scarce though!

That I feel hungry but can still walk may be because my body has become superhuman. If it were the usual, I would have already dried up and rendered unable to stand.

Doing what Tsuki-sama told me, I tried using my given ‘power’ so I concentrated to activate it but I failed(?)

I tried to gather the power onto the palm of my hand but.

I don’t understand it a single bit. I could certainly feel the power gathering but, nothing is happening.

I tried placing my hand on the ground but that was in vain.

I tested a lot of things but.

Only, the objects I have in my hand will slightly move depending on how much energy I utilize. This is probably the most easiest to see and understand form.

But it’s not like it actually moves, it just trembles in my hand.

It’s a mystery. And also, I don’t think I can use this to get out of my current situation.

Well, this power is something precious that Tsuki-sama has given me. I believe that great person wouldn’t make a mistake.

I will try to experiment more with it, I have to understand this power as soon as possible.

Anyways, it’s hot.

In the day it’s reasonably hot.

At night it’s reasonably cold.

That’s how I felt it but.

At noon I could clearly see the heat haze with my eyes. Right now is just like that.

At nights the surface of the rocks began to frost.

This seemed like an incredibly harsh environment for a human, yes.

I once more thank my superhuman body.

Well, without caring about my surroundings I advanced forward at a pretty fast pace.

The moment I reach that mountain there should be a change in the situation, probably. Please may there be. I implore.

The only thing I hear is the wind and my own footsteps!

It’s already been 3 days!

At this point in time there should already be an event right?!

“I see, it’s because I am not a hero anymore~ I’m just an ugly duckling after all”

I began to speak to myself. It may be the effect of loneliness but the times I have said what I was thinking have increased. So sad.

My eyes become slightly hollow. I gazed at the far distance. I want to believe there is human population at that side.

What might the two heroes be doing now I wonder? They are surely being received with open arms by the royalty and nobles, and must be eating a nice feast.

Compared to me.

I look at my back. Nothing but reddish-brown wasteland. The path I have travelled.

Every time I saw a mirage I dashed to it so I should have shortened quite a bit of distance. I most likely wouldn’t even recognize the place I was dropped to.

At first I planned to walk mindlessly and then encounter someone or find a settlement or so I thought but.

It seems that is a privilege that is reserved only for main characters.

Also, to be so perfectly without anything at all. There wasn’t a single shadow of a per- ???

“?? ???”

So.

That voice was slight but.

I tried with all my ability to concentrate my changed body, probably this would be the first time in all my life that I have become so sensitive.

My ears didn’t let the sound escape.

I stop my steps.

I perk up my ears with my hands and silently close my eyes.

Where is it, from where did I hear it?

I have to concentrate. Just concentrate.

As if to not miss even the moment a single drop of water falls.

I definitely heard a voice, I have to make sure of it.

“? Sa… Ple…a”

“It’s over there!!!!!!”

I heard it once more, it was definitely a scream.

I open my eyes. Like if wanting to obtain those sound waves!

I am still admirably fasting though!

My stomach is extremely empty but!

Since the time I came here, it’s the most power I have had.

I kicked the ground and ran.

INSERT INTO `chapter`(`book_id`,`name`,`data`,`number_of_read`,`upload_date`) VALUES(4,'chapter 3','“Sa-Save me!!”

I clearly heard a voice. Somewhere close to that rocky hill.

“Yes with pleasure!!!!” (Makoto)

With a happy reply I dash. My tension had already gone out of the gauge! I felt I could use ultimate skills one after the other.

I see it, I can clearly see it. I really have incredible eyesight. I definitely don’t need glasses. I have already taken out the lens though, it’s only for the looks! (TN: I didn’t know he had glasses. Maybe just a onetime gag he did)

What I saw frightened me but I won’t stop my legs.

There were two things there, one seemed to be a pig and the other was a dog with 2 heads. Oh well, it’s a whole lot better than solitude.

In games there are pigs that can fly in the sky and also a helldog with 3 heads.

Just because they are now in the real world, at this occasion I won’t even care! I am a superhuman over here got a problem with that?!

While I was running I see, the one who wants to be saved is the pig one. Is that what you call an orc?

The one attacking was the 2 headed dog. A fight between mamono(monsters)?

Who I should side with is obvious. The one who raised its voice! Thanks to you I have met living beings after all!!!

That side seems to have already noticed my presence. Both of them are being cautious of the one that is kicking up a cloud of dust(me).

I am thankful. With this the orc-kun(maybe) will be safe. That is if I can beat the dog one though.

“What are you, bastard!! Are you going to get in the way?!” (2 headed dog)

The two headed dog howled. For some reason I could tell the meaning of its howl. I was quite surprised that I could also understand the words of the orc. There is no problem! I don’t mind!

Though it felt weird to hear a howl and the words at same time but.

“Hi! I am a human, Makoto!! Nice to meet you!”

It entered my range of attack.

Being secure of it I used the momentum of my running and plunge, facing the dog I l aimed a flying kick onto him.

“Deryaaaaa!!!” (Makoto)

It was an attack that used my momentum in order to gain the initiative and open the distance.

“Wa, it’s too fast!!” (Dog)

Those became the last words of the dog.

In the middle of the two heads, my kick connects.

It was okay up to that point but…

Just like that, I went through him.

Hai?

My opponent was a mamono right? No, no matter if it was a mamono.

Even if I ran with all my strength, a hit using all the momentum…

No matter how much, isn’t this way too weird?!

“E, Ehmmmm” (Makoto)

The inside of my heart was in panic but I managed to land.

Timidly I turn to my back.

“Ah, well, I have done it” (Makoto)

It was a gruesome spectacle.

The double headed hounds upper body was scattered around, while the lower half was lying on the ground. It was on a level where you wouldn’t know what in the world it had been done to it.

I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry.

To think such a thing would happen I wouldn’t even be able to imagine it. Its true you know?

It was like if a truck had just ran over it.

I turn my eyes away.

I had been the one that had done it but I couldn’t fathom it.

I met eyes with orc-kun.

Compared to the time where it was with the dog I could see that its eyes had even more fear in it.

Strangely, the appearance that is supposed to feel ugly, that I didn’t feel any disgust in it must be because of that bug, I mean, goddess. There won’t be an experience more befitting on not to judge by appearance after all. Saying that I am not beautiful, that I am useless, don’t screw with me.

In a lot of meanings, have I messed up?

But anyways I am able to communicate. I should talk with it.

Ah~ a conversation. What a wonderful act.

I have done quite an inexcusable thing to that dog. Please rest in peace.

I join both of my hands and pray for its happiness in the next world. The next time we meet, may we be able to talk with each other.

Now then.

A conversation right? Finally I will be able to talk with someone.

Feeling a strange anticipation my heart beats faster.

Quietly I look at the orc as I stand in front of it.
Captura
She is totally my type… wait wut?

“Ah~ nice to meet you” (Makoto)

“Hiiii!!! It spooooke!” (Orc)

E?

????????

What? Did I fail right from the get go?!

Nono, it’s my first encounter in three days you know? Like hell I will give up. Impossible.

“I am not a strange person. I am gentle and kind. Do you understand my words?” (Makoto)

The orc-kun(maybe) shakes its head up and down but then soon after shakes it left and right.

I don’t understand what it means. Is that a gesture that only exists in this world?

It also walks in two legs so it is pretty close to a human being though.

No wait. Seeing the piggy-san standing, maybe because it looks close to a human being I unconsciously cornered it too much.

“A person that killed a “Liz” with one attack cantbeagentleandkindperson!” (Orc)

Oh, I see. I can agree to that. That was really unbelievable after all. I think so too.

It seems its murmuring a lot of stuff but its unexpectedly a composed fellow.  Saying “That… that kind of way of doing in” or something like that.

“Okay I get it. I am strong. I am stronger than you!” (Makoto)

“Hiiii!!!” (Orc)

The piggy gets scared and curls its body.

What is with this picture? Saying ‘It spoke?!’ and now getting all scared. To calm it down I try a number of gestures.

Ooh, this is surreal.

Well, in this kind of situation I thought it would be saying ‘I took an interest in you’ or something like that but maybe I am playing too many games. (TN: Must be referring to the fact that the beast race in most novels and games like strong people)

I see, that is something that would work properly for a beast type. A thing that would be more fitted for the dog one.

A pig is not a beast?

Something similar to it would be a goblin huh. That is probably a girl? But I feel that an Oni would fit her image too.

Thinking I have been playing too many games, but I still look for information inside those must be because the existence that should only appear in games, mamono, is in front of me.

“Well, just calm down. It’s true that I am strong but it is also true that I came to help you, you know?” (Makoto)

Lifting both of my arms up I appeal the fact that I am not dangerous.

Yeah. Instead of saying ‘I am stronger than you’ it would be better to appeal that I didn’t come here to harm her.

Anyways, intimidation is not part of my character after all.

“You are the one that cried ‘Save me~!’ So I came here and saved you. I am your ally right?”

Orc-kun(maybe) lifted its head up and faced my way. It seems that her trembling calmed down a bit.

Good good, it looks like I have earned good will. With how this is going…

“R-Really?” (Orc)

Still scared she faced me and looked at my eyes, I nodded at her.

The caution in her expression dimmed and then went to fear again.

“What is up with that?!” (Tl:Nande ya nen?!)

In a place with no one I make a tsukkomi. (TN: tsukkomi means a retort but may also mean slapping a person beside you while retorting to him)

No good. To think communication was so complicated.

I have no money nor things in hand so I have nothing to offer.

W-Will this end in a failure? No way, I can’t give up!

“W-Why is a hyumanabletospeakwithme?! Could it be, youareahyumanthatpossessestamer?!” (Orc)

Tamer?

What is that?

If you ask me why I can speak with her that would be because of a bug like god.

I see, a normal human being, no, even if its normal a human shouldn’t be able to talk with a mamono~

What a power have you given me!

People will misunderstand me with this!

“Ah, gezz!! I, tamer? Wrong! I am lost! I saved you! The end!” (Makoto)

For now let’s be direct.

I will tell her the things that are certain.

“??”

Mu, she is thinking. She is trembling but compared to before its better. I have already made quite the distance between us so I would like it if you stopped doing that though.

Moreover, I am pretty scared too you know?

In a situation where I am facing a piggy standing in two legs, to have the intention of mutual understanding moves me.

The wandering in this place for 3 days wasn’t for nothing.

“??”

I wait silently. What about the reaction on that side? The presence of conversation is zero now.

“I- I get it” (Orc)

YES!

I did it! Thanks! Arigatou! ShieShie!

“Thanksforsavingme” (Orc) (TN: she has been speaking like that)

Gureito, this is a conversation that is like a conversation. And moreover, with good will. This is something to be happy about.

“Nono, I am just glad you are okay. Anyways, is your village close to here?” (Makoto)

I will change my way of addressing to ‘kimi’(you). Saying ‘omae omae’ (TL: you in a rude way) is a bit impolite or at least that’s how I think so.

Even if it’s a village a town or even a house.

Whatever is fine, I just want to sleep in a place with a roof.

But sadly she shook her head horizontally.

“C-Could it be you are also lost?” (Makoto)

She once more shook her head horizontally without vigor.

“I… to tell you the truth, have been lost for 3 days already. Do you know where I can find people around here?” (Makoto)

Once more she shook.

Oh god. Is my situation even changing? This is an event right? Is it not?!

“There is no hyuman village here. This is called the ‘end of the world’, a barren wasteland” (Orc)

End of the world?

That… I think have heard it not too long ago.

… Hey!

That bug, could it be she really threw me to the ends of the world?!

It wasn’t just a way of saying?! Would you normally go to such lengths?!

I feel malice. A really precise malice!

Honestly you would doubt this amount of harassment.

Eh?

It may be called the ends of the world but there may actually be a giant town just in the vicinity?

Too naaiiiiive!!!! Its more naïve than the kindness of Tsuki-sama! (TN: naïve is written amai in jap. That means sweet. He is calling Tsuki-sama sweet not naïve :D)

No way, there is definitely no way.

I have already understood the personality of that bug. She doesn’t admit anything that is not beautiful. First of all the appearance must be an okay.

Most likely the other two were really beautiful. To have been taken a liking by that man-hater bug, to have given them power and protection and blessings t-they must have been r-really beautiful right?!

“I am on my way to Shen-sama’s god mountain to sacrifice myself” (Orc)

While I was running wild with my hate to the goddess that I haven’t seen the form of, she continued her conversation.

Yaay an event flag~. (TN: omg his changes of mood are so crazy)

I haven’t even arrived to a village or a town and I have already encountered an event that smells of mid-boss battle~

I am going to have a nosebleed~

While tears ran down her eyes she told me that shocking reality of hers.

Hearing her out I understood that she was a highland orc that lives in the plateau, it seems to be a high level orc tribe.

Though from the appearance it doesn’t look like that.

Once every half a year, the owner of the mountain called the god mountain requests a young female to be sacrificed.

If they don’t do so, a thick mist covers the village and the crops won’t grow up properly.

That’s incredible highland orc. To not be plundering and do hunting and agriculture. You have a proper livelihood.

They are practically humans. Taking out the appearance.

By the way.

For some reason I feel like flags are standing one after the other. (TN: Flags are like events in games that advance you to a certain point)

From the several lines of explanation and situation, you should already know what kind of flag it is right everyone?

A battle flag? Nono it’s a bit different.

A sense of optimism? Or maybe a sweet poison called hope?

Okay, lets arrange the facts.

    I was thrown to another world.
    I followed a scream and helped a girl(orc) from a mamono.
    And so, the first girl I met in this world tells me that she will soon be sacrificed.
    And then I go and destroy this talk about a sacrifice (Not yet)

Do you understand now?

It’s a he.ro.i.ne flaaaaaggggg!!!?!”?!”?!? (Because it’s a horrible spectacle we have decided not to depict the reaction of our main character)

And now try doing the (not yet)!

It would seriously stand up! (TN: the flag you lechers)

Impossible, definitely impossible.

Of course, I am not the type who would judge a girl by her looks. She is normal. And her impression is pretty light.

But,but if I am to go out with someone I would like it to be human(looking)!

Is this a luxury?!

If it’s (looking) then an orc also counts?

Nononono, that’s called sophism.

I also have experience like a normal human. I am not going to stick my head on things like prejudice or preconception.

Certainly from the girl orc, I can’t smell that bad odor that I know of. Rather, I can smell the nice scent of what seemed to be flowers from her.

Like a senpai you admire kind of?

Ha!!

W-Wrong! That’s not how it is!

Listen well, in my ‘experience’ there are ‘obvious’ breech of morals as well.

A glamour to the point of looking unnatural, people who their bodies have stopped growing up at an early stage, the girl that represents the elfs, beast race with animal ears and armor made of flesh.

Spirits that have humanoid form, the demon race that would have blue or black or sometimes green skin. Depending on its looks even a robot is fine!

An orc.

But an orc is impossible.

That is discrimination?!

Shut up!! If the base of its form is not human-like I don’t want! That part I won’t back down! I will not back down!

Playing all of my many experiences in the dream world of men, I regrettably, truly regrettably have not have an orc girl as a conquer target.

Wa, experience? That’s right, it’s in games! Is that bad?!

Anyways, you get it. For her to be a conquer target will never happen!

“So that’s why, I’m sorry” (Makoto)

I apologized to the girl ahead of time. This kind of things is better to settle as soon as you can.

“E, what are you talking about?” (Orc)

Damn. I messed up my heart conflicts with the conversation at hand. This is a blunder.

“W-Well~ It’s nothing at all~” (Makoto)

The girl was confused. But that was only for a short moment, as she soon smiled again (maybe? I don’t know) to me.

“Anyways, if it’s okay with you, please let me compensate you, Makoto-sama” (Orc)

Wow, to think she remembered my name after that entrance. Yeah, I will forget that after that she said ‘It spoke?!’

What a well-mannered lady. How regrettable. More than a human girl I would have liked her to be a dog girl or a cat girl though~

“Un, I am Makoto. By the way, I am 17 years old. Nice to meet you” (Makoto)

“I am Ema. I am also 17 years old” (Ema)

To think her age was also fitting! It’s really that only her race made it that the flag be only a battle flag.

By the way, the ‘don’t marry’ that the bug told me is not even remaining in my mind.

Tsuki-sama told me I was able to do anything I wanted after all~

“Just ahead of here, there is the last point the ‘Body Purifying Field’ to reach the god mountain. Please rest your body that has been tired by your travels there” (Ema)

Is that like a place to take a break? She is a really good girl.

It is quite cheap but it’s like she is making me her bodyguard until we reach that ‘Body Purifying Field’ place. Well if it’s like before there won’t be problems. If a rock falls I feel I can repel it as well.

“T-Thanks Ema” (Makoto)

I accept her invitation and we begin walking to the direction of that so called God Mountain.

Strangely, the more I talk with her the more clearly I can understand her way of speaking. (TN: Yeah, she has been speaking messily since a while ago, I don’t want you guys to go through that trouble)

That bug must have given me a power that lets me understand the language of another race the more I speak to them. Like tuning to their thoughts.

Well, I don’t have any problems with that.

While speaking with her I continue my travels.

She told me about how her village is slowly losing its young girls. She told me stories about the festivals that her village had done in the times of peace.

If 2 young girls went every year as sacrifice in the future it would perish. It was a simple calculation. Even a kid would know that.

From the start, the Ema that was a sacrifice and was heading to her dead place.

For her way of speaking to get gloomy every now and then was not surprising.

I just responded her and followed her but, I still had a number of questions.

I will later think about them carefully.

When I reach the last resting point what should I do.

If I go and defeat the mid-boss the flag would seriously stand right?

She is a good girl but… she is a really good girl but!

She has a nice personality, her age is close too. She is also the village chief’s daughter so it may look like I’m a gold digger.

Muu~ really, why are you not a human Ema?

It could be that you are actually a beautiful princess that has been cursed.

Human civilization is too far away from here so there is no chance.

“Ah, that is the place” (Ema)

Ema-san points a finger to a cave. It certainly looks like it was made artificially. The state of the entrance as well as the road to it. There is clearly signs of hands having worked on it.

“Um, Makoto-sama. I am sorry but can you wait here for a bit? I have to go explain to the people that are protecting this place about Makoto-sama first” (Ema)

“Understood” (Makoto)

It’s quite plausible. If I suddenly went with her I might get attacked.

I have understood Ema-san’s disposition a little bit.

There is no way she would bring an army corp to attack me.

Even if it does come to that since I can clearly see the entrance from here I would be able to escape.

Confirming that Ema’s figure had disappeared into the cave, I began to think about the future.

At this rate Ema-san will die. She is a sacrifice after all.

That girl is really a good orc. Moreover she is the first person I spoke to.

It may be a little different but she was like a comrade.

If it’s possible I would want to save her but, that flag is harsh. And the strength of my enemy is unknown.

If I think about all that has happened it wouldn’t be strange to encounter a last boss-like existence.

This is totally a maso-game.

Though it’s not a game but reality so it might be obvious that it would be tough.

If I am able to successfully get information in that cave.

Early in the morning I will slip out, defeat that ‘god’ and as a result I will save the girl.

It’s okay if I just disappear after that.

If I promise her that her village will be save she would have to return to the village after all.

The boss that Ema-san called Shen-sama, if it’s me I may be able to speak with it. There should be other ways to resolve things aside from fighting.

I see Ema-san that is waving her hand at the entrance of the cave. She is smiling. She must have succeeded in her negotiation.

Seeing her appearance.

I thought for a little bit, to do a hero sham that the Goddess said I wasn’t needed to do.

INSERT INTO `chapter`(`book_id`,`name`,`data`,`number_of_read`,`upload_date`) VALUES(4,'chapter 4','“Then, please try doing it” (Ema)

Like Ema told me to I chant the incantation.

The language that is used for the incantation is different from the orc one but for me it sounded like normal words. More like, if I willed to use it I felt like the words naturally flowed. By the sensation I noticed that I was the one that was saying it.

It seemed like an incantation is a special thing so it wouldn’t become your spoken language no matter what, I was going to show that I could but I stopped from doing so.

They told me it was like accumulating all the power inside your body but I decided to not do it.

The enhancement of physical and magical power that Tsuki-sama taught me, if I seriously used that it might turn into a really troublesome situation.

What I would be using now was the fire bullet magic, brid. It didn’t have to be fire, it seems that the same kind of magic of other elements is also called brid. A basic attack magic or so she told me.

A low ranked magic that could be used for ignition but even though this place was big it was still a cave.

If it becomes a hell fire you could die from oxygen deprivation or from the heat. I didn’t understand the structure of magic so I didn’t feel like trying it.

I was in half doubt if it would come out or not but they say you have to try to know so…

“Brid!”

In a second.

From my surroundings something hard to define, a ‘sensation’ was flowing out of my body.

In front of my extended right hand, a flame that looked like a cotton in fire was created.

That fire stopped there for a moment and then while shaking, it disappeared.

“Ooooh~! Is this magic?!” (Makoto)

My voice grew excited.

“Yeah, that is the initial stage of when you activate brid. To think you would be able to activate it at the first try” (Ema)

Ema that was instructing me, was impressed and praised me. A big part of it might be because I could understand the incantation language (temporal name).

I see~ this is what they call magic~♫

For one to do it one has to try, or at least that is what someone told me when I extended my hand. With this it’s proved.

To think the day would come when I can use magic!

In a game it’s the standard but for it to really happen~

Ufuuuu, ufufufufufu

I began laughing spontaneously.

“Imagine that fire as a clear image of a ball and then picture it impacting your objective to shoot it. That would be the finished state of brid” (Ema)

The voice of Ema’s instructions cooled me down from my trip.

I see, if you are talking about a fire ball you would obviously need to throw it for it to be proper. To shape your fire as a ball with the image of it… Does it mean that brid is the summoning of fire?

Well for now let’s leave that aside.

“I see~ then then” (Makoto)

With a good mood I mutter a short aria (incantation) of brid.

The flowing out of something. This is most likely maryoku (magic power). Certainly, I now clearly understand why Ema told me that instead of just understanding, trying it out is a lot faster.

Even with the explanation I was blank. Now I sort of understand this maryoku that is supposed to be all around the world.

The fire appears once more.

By controlling this.

I form it into a ball and…

The fire, without disappearing, it flickers. When I imagine it the size of a baseball ball, the flickering becomes stronger and smoothly comes a spherical shape.

“Impressive, to do it to this point with just what I said” (Ema)

The surprise that Ema gave off is also pleasant.

Then she exchanged looks with the orcs in the cave and they all gathered to a side of the wall. The orcs were pretty big and seem likes they are a race that boast in physical strength.

The distance is 5-6m.

The girl looked at me and nodded so I point the fire ball at a rock.

Then strongly picturing ‘hitting the middle’ (TN: ‘Nakateru’ is supposed to be an archery term) I order it to fly off.

It flew off at the speed of a person throwing it, going straight and then hitting.

Inside the cave, a shock and hot wind occur. Well, it was actually not that much. Calling it hot wind was too much. It was more like a lukewarm wind.

The rock scatters and loses it shape. It seems to have quite the power. That is not just an empty spell reassures me.

“With this I have learned brid right? Ema” (Makoto)

“T-That’s right” (Ema)

Her way of speaking returned to shaky. It seems like I did something pretty impressive.

“I was actually just thinking of teaching you to make a simple light and then go for spell image training or stuff like that but…” (Ema)

It looks like I skipped quite a lot of steps. Then that means I can already use magic my magic as a light?!

Oh? Magic is fun. It looks like it will be fun.

A subject I love has increased by one now.

Moreover, maybe it’s because I am still learning but, this is fun~♫

“Oh? Teach me teach me. I don’t mind if you just tell me the incantation. Teach me a whole lot more” (Makoto)

I was cheery right now.

“Ah, yes. Then, I will put them all together at a later time. Anyways Makoto-sama, your maryoku perception is okay now?” (Ema)

“A, I can slightly feel it. It is that thing that flows out whenever you use a magic right?” (Makoto)

“E~ that’s right. As expected, you’re learning ability is on a genius level” (Ema)

“Well, I am the type that understands when I think it in my head but it is like Ema said. I understood that it is convenient to try it out first” (Makoto)

It was truly like that. Really, Ema would be a nice sensei (teacher).

“Then can you grasp that it is also inside your own body?” (Ema)

“N?” (Makoto)

I try concentrating as she told me.

As always, the way to use the power that Tsuki-sama has given me is still a complete mystery.

But certainly.

It may be because of the effects of using magic, I can sense that a different power is flowing through my body.

It smells just like what is all around.

This is my own maryoku.

It’s a pretty ambiguous feeling. It felt like dipping in water and being soaked.

If it’s like that in my whole body, I don’t really know.

“Yeah, there is. So this is my maryoku” (Makoto)

“Having that much physical strength and to be able to master magic so easily. Makoto-sama might be suited for a magic swordsman job” (Ema)

“Job?” (Makoto)

Heyhey, this world is more game-like than I originally thought.

Does it also have job corrections or unique abilities as well?

“Eh~ then your level must be pretty high” (Ema)

Level she says.

Uh?

With this I feel I must change my way of seeing this world.

Is this like an RPG? Then that ‘Liz’ something must have given me exp. It didn’t seem like it dropped gold though.

“Uh… who knows? I don’t know myself” (Makoto)

In the time we were coming here I had introduced myself to Ema and had explained about my economic situation and many other things.

Honestly, I said a lot of lies about me.

If I told her the truth, Ema would surely think I am a sad person with brain problems.

When I woke up I was already here.

And for some reason my memories are fuzzy. Well, it is true that I have no memories of this world so it wouldn’t be that much of a lie.

I feel bad for deceiving a nice orc but to think it would help at this moment.

“If it’s just the level we can probably figure it out” (Ema)

She took out a piece of paper.

“What is this?” (Makoto)

“It’s a paper that can tell the strength of someone. Well, it somewhat does. A hyuman dropped it a long time ago” (TN: Did they kill him?! Was it a drop item?!)

Hyuman. Eh, isn’t that a person?!

Now that she says it, it’s not human but hyuman over here.

“Eh~ what do we do with this?” (Makoto)

Well, for now it doesn’t matter. Let’s have my level measured first.

“Grab it please” (Ema)

“Hoi” (Makoto)

I grab it like she told me to. It was white but the moment I grabbed it, it became blue. A light blue to be more precise.

“Ara, it can’t possibly be” (Ema)

Ema was wondered by it. Is it a weird color?

All the other ones that Ema had presented me and told about me defeating the Liz were all here and had a puzzled expression as well.

“What? Is it a strange color?” (Makoto)

“Ummm…” (Ema)

“Umu, tell me” (Makoto)

I am prepared. After all it’s only telling me a number. It’s not like it would change anything~

“Level 1” (Ema)

Uuuuh…

Right~ I have to ask about the hyumans~♫

INSERT INTO `chapter`(`book_id`,`name`,`data`,`number_of_read`,`upload_date`) VALUES(4,'chapter 5','N~ what a refreshing morning.

From the white surfaced rocky mountain I feel a fresh wind flow on me.

Well, I will give up on being surprised by my own superhuman specs. When I am explaining to someone I will just tell them what I have seen. Is it normal that this is not a refreshing wind but a freezing gale?

For the me that can already sense the maryoku in the air, the way I see the world has changed and I feel ‘refreshed’ though.

Now, I have been confirmed that I am a level 1.

That is strange.

If I was a high level from the start then I would understand why I wouldn’t level up by defeating the Liz but…

If I am a level 1 it should go up. Or is that dog really weak?

Ema-san also witnessed me defeating it in that fight so, is it because it was a surprise attack?

N~ on top of my existence being a cheat, the concept of level doesn’t properly apply to me.

Even though I feel a bit sad about it I am very calm.

“Then, shall I do it”

I headed to the gate guard-san and requested him to pass onto Ema something.

A letter.

Its incredible right? To think that not only talk but I could also write it.

I could perfectly read and write.

Cheat banzai. I have learned to respect bugs a bit. Now that it has come to this I can’t help but wonder if the other heroes are almighty or something.

With this if I reach a human settlement I feel that I could gain money by doing trading between humans and mamono.

I didn’t write that much for the content.

I am going to see if I can do something about that whatever God.

I will most likely not return unscathed, so don’t worry about me and just return to the village. Thanks.

Is how it slightly went in the contents. There was some small talk and explanations as well though.

I didn’t have any intention to return to the cave again.

In the end not only did she teach me magic, I was also able to obtain a map of the area around here.

After talking to that God I plan to go straight to the human settlement.

There seems to be a strange place where people that have obtained rare materials by traveling all over the world and people that pursuit knowledge gather.

There is still quite the distance to the cave.

Anyways, to arrive I think with my fastest speed (counting the time I have already travelled) it would take one week, if something happens on the way it would take maybe 10 days.

In the way there were a number of race settlements (all mamono without exception). I can speak with them so it didn’t become a battle all the time.

In terms of food it should be fine for now. I was able to go for 3 days without eating after all.

If I go with my intuition I think I would be fine even with 5 days. I don’t want to do that though. For the orcs, the food they gave me must have been important for them too. I have to eat it carefully.

While thinking those things I circumvent a rocky mountain and head for the conspicuously tall mountain. God Mountain huh.

In reality I wasn’t that preoccupied about that mamono or God called Shen.

Because there was something that worried me more than that.

Aside from the sacrifices, that there was no one who had seen Shen is the first thing that got me wondering. Because that meant that no one alive has met with him.

And then the fact that the sacrifice must go through the trouble of travelling the desert all alone was weird.

Because if she can’t reach her destination there was no point in the sacrifice.

That the sacrifice reaches the several safe points to ‘purify the body’ she has already done her duty. Is what they told me but.

What is with that logic? Isn’t there already no point in the sacrifice?

Because in reality, Ema was almost going to become food to a Liz after all.

That’s right, and that Liz.

That mamono seems to be in all parts of the world but it seems that one was quite far away from the area it should be inhabiting.

And it seems they normally hunt in groups.

Then, that situation where Ema gets attacked is just too weird.

I can certainly feel someone trying to slowly destroy the village of highland orcs from the conversations I have had with Ema.

But is that the will of that so called Shen?

I feel a third party involved in this. Or it could even be an internal affair between the highland orcs.

Those two possibilities swirled in my mind.

If they just wanted to destroy it then the sacrifice system sounds stupid. Because they could use the mist and in just a few years it would go down after all.

“Slowly huh” (Makoto)

I feel that is the key point of the issue.

I think there is meaning in taking their time.

If Shen wanted something else aside from the sacrifice it would have certainly requested it on top of the sacrifices.

So if there is an existence that is looking for time then that means it doesn’t have to do with Shen itself.

A third party, or a rebellion huh.

It may be me jumping to conclusions. It could even be completely different from what I thought. That guy is not a person after all.

It’s not certain that it would have the same thinking pattern of a human. If I take that into account, my basis would all crumble.

But in my current situation, since I don’t have enough material to go on I decided to follow that line of thinking.

If it becomes a fight then let it become a fight.

There may even be a part of me that wants that to happen.

Magic, maryoku.

It’s true that I want to utilize them.

There are many other things I want to learn as well but I had to resolve this before Ema departed so.

Actually the magic to create light I secretly heard the incantation from the gate guard so I have already learnt it!

Morals? Aside from the list of magic I have gotten, I need to increase my repertoire of magic a way or another.

“I should try it out now. To try it when the real fight begins would be a bit…” (Makoto)

The first will be at full power.

I don’t know how exhausting it would be. Then I should try it at least once.

—

Now that that’s decided.

I should prepare everything first.

Whispering lowly I made a flame brid the same size as last night. Making it in a ball I throw it wherever. Success.

Good.

Let’s do it.

I relaxed my body and with prudence I chant an aria, pouring all of my energy while picturing a ‘strong flame’. But I chant it inside my mind.

And I try to whisper it to the brid. Number 1 thing I wanted to try. If I can use it without saying it.

Success. I was able to make a condensed and flickering deep crimson flame that was many times stronger than the one last night.

I am glad. If I tried to do this in the cave without having the image of a ball first it would have become a disaster. Most likely not only me but all my surroundings would be caught on fire.

Now then, a target.

In the path to the mountain called God Mountain, at the foot of the mountain just further ahead I could see a gate like thing. That should do fine. The distance from here is more than a hundred meters. I should be grateful for my out of the world eyesight.

Things I want to try, number 2. I do archery.

Last night I also imagined ‘hitting in the middle’ to make the fire ball fly out and hit.

So I was wondering if I could make a bow and an arrow and shoot it just like that ball.

And while I’m at it I want to know how flexible can the brid be.

That’s right.

I do a seiza (a Japanese formal way of sitting) as I do in archery club before I hold the bow.

Finishing preparing my mind I begin to concentrate.

If i start by doing this first, i would know the results of what i’m gonna do.

This is something that my friends in the club ask me a lot when we are preparing our bows. Why are you beginning from the sitting part? Because it gives you confidence in hitting the middle?

If you ask me why then I do have a memory which makes me smile bitterly. That I am like ‘this’ is no surprise. I was doing archery with the objective of training my body.

At first when I hit the target I was happy. But that happiness began fading as it became easier to.

But with technique there is a limit to how precise you can be.

At first, to increase my accuracy I challenged many things.

I endeavored myself by closing my eyes and calming down. Many number of times I simulated my gesture of when I hit the target.

My stance and posture, my every move and action in archery I continued to concentrate on it.

By the time I noticed the sensei told me I could use the dojo anytime I wanted, and in exchange I stopped sitting with people of my same generation.

Now that I think about it that must have been sensei’s concern for me.

For the other people to not get weird out by my strangeness.

After long.

When I enter the dojo, to change my mood I continued doing it. Sitting in seiza, the moment I face my target I have already pictured myself hitting it. And in reality it came true.

When I entered high school and joined the archery club.

The childishness around me brought a smile to me. Then I had realized my own abnormality.

When I asked for advice from the sensei she didn’t know that I was in archery club and was really surprised.

The moment I said it was because I liked using the bow my sensei began laughing in amazement.

Sensei must have decided on something at that moment. She told me she would teach me archery.

The actual combat archery that has been passed down in sensei’s family was an art I had no idea of. It was filled with techniques that were crafted for many different situations.

But even with that I still didn’t change my concept of ‘hitting in the middle’

After 1 year of learning, sensei told me that with this it was over and tested me out. And I passed.

Second year of senior high school. It wasn’t that long ago.

I had gotten the position of vice-president of the club. Following the instructions of sensei I didn’t enter a single tournament. The senpais nominated me as vice-president as I didn’t have that many opportunities to use the bow. (TN: Yeah being a vice-president is having chores. Not that you they noticed you)

Well, I felt a bit happy that I was being relied upon by the president though. Just like that I concentrated on teaching my kohai (underclassmen) and was enjoying my school life until I was shoved this crazy talk about another world.

When I think about it, I was quite abnormal huh. The kohai that called me by saying ‘Senpai senpai’ was really nice.

Oh, there is no helping that I feel homesick. Reality reality. Good, my fire is still stable.

Well, to get serious after long.

My aim is that Shinto-like gates’ middle.

By habit I place my left hand as if holding a bow, my extended hand placed horizontal to my face just a bit behind of it.

I try to simulate setting the arrow on the bow. If I get burned while taking the ball of fire in my hand I will throw it away.

Now show it to me, the power of my all out magic.

I realize the arrow. It was only an image inside of my mind but the ball of fire slowly curled.

And in a moment it had become a cylinder shape like an arrow and impacted the gate. A piercing fire arrow.

“It’s a success. There is no problem with its speed” (Makoto)

This wasn’t a speed of someone throwing it, it flew exactly like if it was shot out by something. It would be good to train with it, though it was the same as having a bow in hand. This is a big step forward. It’s reassuring.

“Huh?” (Makoto)

The arrow didn’t disappear, staying pierced on the gate and began to distort. Like if trying to resist, it got conspicuously bigger wriggling and distorting.

The fire arrow exploded.

Along with the gate.

With one second lag, the hot wind blew against me. It was fairly hot. To the point I hesitate to breath. Is that what they mean to incinerate completely?!

“This is bad, the gate disappeared” (Makoto)

Well it’s okay if it’s just the gate. Thinking that I began to walk and saw an unbelievable thing.

Something moved.

If in the vicinities of the gate there were living beings…

This is bad.

It must be an incredibly awful situation over there with that direct hit.

If it’s moving I may be able to make it in time.

I can say that I didn’t have the intention to hurt anyone but there is no other way. In this situation if I make it in time I should return to the highland orcs cave to ask for medical treatment.

Anyways, I should go to the scene of the crime.

I run like if blowing away all my cold sweat away.

—-

“You bastard, what are you?!”

“Uwaaa, this is already…” (Makoto)

It’s already too late. There were 4 living-looking creatures charred.

And another one had its half blown away. How did he talk?

It must have incredible vitality.

“Ah well~ aren’t you full of vigor?” (Makoto)

Because he was talking with me so normally I felt my tension going down.

“Soon I will be dying!”

“Right, of course” (Makoto)

“Those bastard highland orcs, are you telling me that they had noticed the plan of us, the demon race? Or are they intending on killing a dragon?!”

“Stop! Stoppu da! You, don’t talk anymore!” (Makoto)

“Kukuku, my life cannot be saved anymore. Let me talk till the end”

Well yeah you won’t be able to be saved but the one who did it was me though?!

You are making a lot of dangerous looking flags stand one after the other you know?!

What kind of stupid thing is this?!

“If they had just cooperated with us as told the problem would have been solved and we would have sum them up to our ranks but to think that they had such a monster like you!”

Uooooooo!!!

The intervention of the third party was behind the scenes?! I just hit them!

“Well you have destroyed even the gate. That guy is one that draws conclusion fast. With this the rage of Shen will become reality”

“Hey wait?! Will it piss off Shen that much to destroy the gate?!” (Makoto)

This is bad this is bad this is bad. It’s the pattern of entering a boss fight without even going to the save point.

If I select the conversation command. ‘This is not the time for that!’ Is what I feel it would say.

It will definitely come!!

“A mighty dragon race, in its own territory, will see its gate destroyed. Kukukuku serves you right!!!”

After saying all he wanted to say he disappeared like sand. He must have died believing his own words.

The other 4 bodies had already disappeared. Did they wither the same way?

And then, a tremor.

Furthermore a cloud that was covering the mountain was lowering in altitude.

A cloud, no, if I think of its attributes it would be mist.

Anyways, it was a strange phenomenon.

I will die!

I came with the intention of conversing and then after shaking hands I would return happily back.

No. I didn’t think that it would be such a dangerous thing that was able to make an unnatural phenomenon occur!

I will be buried then killed and then violated?! That the order is weird?!

My prediction was correct and yet! Why did it become like this?!

The bad guys were the devil race though! The third party dude!

“Shen-sama, please listen to what I have to say!” (Makoto)

I shouted as so to the mist that had already lowered by metres of its original location.

At that place there was something even I recognized. With an enraged facial expression showing its fangs, a dragon-sama had descended.

I could clearly tell that it would bite me to death at any moment though!

Anyways…

“Shen isnt a giant clam?!!!!” (Makoto) (TN: 蜃 refers to a giant clam but can also be a dragon. I don’t know its details as I don’t know to read Chinese though)

In another world my own knowledge doesn’t work.

I don’t want to pass on like this.

INSERT INTO `chapter`(`book_id`,`name`,`data`,`number_of_read`,`upload_date`) VALUES(4,'chapter 6','Fangs that would easily crush a human being were coming right in front of my eyes.

Because I have a superhuman body I can stop it. Come ahead and try.

…

Like hell I would say that! There is nothing in this world more unbelievable than me!!

This is a set thing, no, a reality would not be an exaggeration!

In panic I jump behind it.

The dragon, without minding that its bite had missed it began to draw near me again. Another biting attack!

A snake flying in midair, now that I think about it it’s really hard to predict its movements?!

“What?!” (Shen)

Turning my body I jump to the sides.

Safe! I am still alive.

I don’t let the dragon out of my sight. By seeing the size of the giant mouth that can easily crunch me down, I am able to somehow determine the size of its head.

I try to figure out how is its whole body.

What, so it’s like many times bigger than a bullet train huh. I am not sure of its length though.

…

I’m going to die!!

What a stupid turn of events, supervisor!! Hey bug, come out bug!!

You should certainly have a legendary weapon or a legendary tool lying over there right?!

The mist has finally come all the way down here.

I can’t clearly see my surroundings nor my own hands.

I can’t even see where I am standing.

There is such a big dragon so close to me, yet I can’t even see its figure.

Moreover, if the dragon moves, the mist should also undulate with it. But the mist stays calm, just staying in place.

The one creating that mist is certainly, that dragon Shen huh. No fair.

To top it off, its presence.

To not even be able to feel that is just too weird. This mist is not a normal mist after all.

Disadvantageous, this is an incredibly disadvantageous situation.

Chills run down the nape of my neck.

I run at that moment and then turn my head to look behind.

A giant mouth was there.

“Is it fair that I can’t feel its presence this much?!” (Makoto)

I don’t have space to return blows.

When you are fighting an opponent with a giant body, the first thing one must think is the opening in its attacks and the time to get a blow in. It’s established that you must evade and defend every single blow that opponent does. Probably.

Anyways, the conclusion I have reached from all my action games and fighting games is that in this moments I should just calm down. In this kind of situation I can’t defend carelessly.

But I can’t see its body and it’s able to suddenly appear behind me and chomp. In that case I can’t even counter! What a shitty game method!

Like fighting a last boss in a new fighting game you got.

And moreover after that body like a snake, comes the head.

If I evade its attack that head would come right in front of me to chomp me. That’s why I can’t take that moment to get one hit to its body. And I don’t even know if there are claws in there as well.

What should I do?! What should I do?!

3 blue cards began to float inside of my head. Well, aren’t we pretty composed myself? Lets see.

    You should just evade it with spirit and then get a hit in!
    Then just clear away the mist, now go ahead and blow some wind!
    The one who hits first wins! Attack randomly!

The first one seems impossible. My six sense is telling me that I can’t attack in that situation.

Second one. Call Zhuge Liang.

Third one. Lowering my attack strength and relying on speed to hit all over the place. Anyways I could throw fire balls all over the place and locate the enemy’s location. And in the location I confirm, I will shoot a fire arrow.

Yes, that’s it. The third one looks doable.

More like, with my head, that is the limit.

I just have to do it. In this close to zero distance, I don’t think I will be able to last long. If I fall into panic I will be hunt down.

~Shen POV~

Enveloping him in the mist, I will make my opponent conscious of my attacks and then drag him into ‘Asora’ and kill him.

I am, in the dragons’ ranks, one of the most superior ones. I am called ‘invincible’

But the reason of being invincible is because of my power ‘Asora’

Using my mist as an intermediary, I am able to drag anything that my mist has seized into a world that I have created.

In that world I am able to limit magic, and I can bend the laws of physic.

For me to lose at that place is impossible. The me inside Asora is not my real body after all.

My body is in some way detached so even if I lose there, my real body will not be there anymore.

The moment I drag him there, I could just withdraw after all. In that situation I can one sidedly attack him.

In the past there has been no events where I haven’t been able to eliminate my enemy in Asora.

And I plan to do just that to the fool that destroyed my gate.

Before the mist arrived I bit two times, the moment it arrived I would just need to use it as an intermediary and take him away to Asora, with that it should be the end.

Yet.

I couldn’t drag him away.

No matter how many times I try, it felt like forcefully trying to put something big inside a small hole. (TN: hehehehe~)

Was the door I made too small?

Then I will just have to hunt him down inside this mist.

I tried attacking him from behind.

But he somehow was able to detect me and evade it.

What an incredibly troublesome hyuman. But with this I can’t just kill him.

I have to check why I am unable to drag him to Asora.

How he is able to evade me in this mist that is supposed to wane all senses. Is that just a coincidence?

If this continues, my invincibility will begin to sway.

If the one who instigated him to do this is another superior dragon then I have to certainly settle this score.

I have only been sleeping in this extremity of the world so I don’t know of any negativity I have instilled though.

If its just because it envies my tittle of invincible then I won’t forgive it. No matter what enemy it is I will bring it down.

I inspect the state of the hyuman. On my side, I can see him clearly.

Is that a fire ball? He is throwing them here and there.

Too bad for him, I have a resistance to elements. At that level I will be able to easily bear it.

This decision was wrong.

I began to circle my prey while being cautious of it. Of course I was reading the trajectory of the brids and evading them but.

One of them got me.

It hit my body.

It didn’t hurt one bit but, the mist surrounding me cleared slightly. My scaled body was now in clear sight.

It was a speed that could be said only took an instant.

The hyuman ,concentrating his maryoku,created immediately an abnormally condensed brid. And accurately pointed it at my body.

I tried to bend my body up to evade it but.

I couldn’t make it. In just an instant it came sharply to me as if it was an arrow and ‘pierced’ my body.

In my body that is resistant to fire the same brid that I shouldn’t feel the heat from and it was the same hyuman’s brid but.

It pierced me with an unbelievable speed, and exploded.

Tremendous heat and pain.

“Agyaaaaaa!!!!” (Shen)

Without noticing that the blast had cleared away most of the mist around.

I, in the first time of my life, had done the thing called scream.

My body, what has become of my body?!

Not noticing my own situation, the me at that time hurriedly checked the place that had received the attack.

The part that had received that atrocious attack had been half burned and gouge out.

The inside of my heart that had gone blank with amazement was soon filled with rage.

With bloodshot eyes I search for that hyuman!

This is not a prey anymore. He is not a prey that I should hunt, he is a sworn enemy I must destroy!

But at this moment I shouldn’t have grown anxious about my wound.

I shouldn’t have lost sight of him.

Searching for him, I had finally found him in my field of vision!

He was in a close blind spot of mine.

What is this, what is this, what is this thing!!

“Desperation Hand Thrust!” (Makoto)

Thrust!

Saying something I couldn’t understand well, he drives his fist into my cheek.

Feeling like a hammer had hit me, the insides of my head felt like stars were whirling. This is not the physical strength of a hyuman! Its like an Ogre or a Giant, or maybe even stronger than that?!

“If that isn’t enough then! Backhanded Fist!” (Makoto)

Backfist!

Moreover, he attacks me in the same place!!

It was not in the same proportion as the last one!

It’s an outrageous power. Not only my face, all of my body is sent in the opposite direction.

But a reward has come after all the damage!

With this I will be able to once again slip into my mist.

I correct myself. This hyuman is dangerous, he is clearly not normal. There is no doubt that he is under the divine protection of someone.

As expected its one of the superior dragons? He is a hyuman, this kind of strengthening is just unbelievable.

Then that means… a god?!

That ever changing Goddess?!

If its that then it wouldn’t be that impossible. But this hyuman has the appearance of a normal person.

He doesn’t look like a person who would be able to gain the affection of that Goddess.

Then who in the world. I will not back down from the pain, this is my first time getting hit in the face. The burned part in my body still hurts.

Just what!

?!?!?!?!?!

“Why is the place I am in…?” (Shen)

Now, in my right side. He was… he was there.

No way. No matter what, inside the mist it should be impossible. It’s true that it has become thinner but for him to be able to…

“Now that it has come to this I will use my certain kill skill…” (Makoto)

His hand began to grow red. He said a really dangerous word. W-What is he… trying to do?

“Frog Jump UPPER!!” (Makoto)
Shoryuken!
Shoryuken!

He drives his fist onto my chin.

Then.

“Become a STAAAARR!!!” (Makoto)

Half of my body was sent flying by his fist. And just like that my body crumbled in the opposite direction.

In my consciousness that I could barely sustain.

Even if I hadn’t perished yet, this was an overwhelmingly dangerous dilemma.

What a humiliation.

I will not care about the methods I utilize. I understand this well.

In my collapsed state, I pretend that I have lost consciousness and begin to search for his location inside the mist.

I silently breathe a mist that is used for mirages.

Even without Asora, my powers are not that simple.

My true nature is mirage. I can peek into the memories of my target, after that I am able to reproduce illusions that my enemy wants or doesn’t want.

If I make a barrier of deep mist and pour in my power I can make the illusion even more real to the point that it’s no different from reality.

For some reason I can’t drag this guy to Asora.

Then taking this sudden situation into account I will just trap him inside this mist and ‘keep him’ until he dies.

It’s no good if it’s an illusion he doesn’t want. There might be problems if he struggles.

Showing him an illusion he wants, inside that happiness he will die of starvation. Hyuman, no matter how strengthened you are, with 10 days you should definitely die.

If 10 days is not enough 1 month, I can even go on for 1 year.

With my new resolution I search for the hyuman.

To think I would have to play dead and that I had to choose a way of killing that was like trying to curry favor.

With his back straightened, the man breathes.

But this is just him pretending. The mist around him is telling me that that man has not lowered his guard down. What a through attitude.

And slowly edging, he checks his surroundings. And without a single bit of negligence, he went ‘out of the mist’.

This time surely, his cautiousness will slacken. It’s something normal. There is no doubt that ‘he went out of the mist’, or so he thinks!

He didn’t chant an aria!

Now. The place he is in is a scenery of ‘out of the mist’ that I projected but its still ‘inside the mist’.

I can do it!

I open my eyes! And the hyuman jumps out in a single breath. As expected. To think he can move to that extend.

But you are too late.

“This is the end” (Shen)

The end

With flooding emotions I create a square space wrapped up by a barrier of mist.

“N? This is… the clubs archery dojo?” (Makoto)

The inside of my mind is not clear. Why, am I here?

Suddenly… not, right?

If I am inside the dojo its club activities. The strange uneasiness disappears as I reorder my thoughts.

I am still wearing my dogi (TN: uniform for training used in japan).

In my hands I had my bow.

It’s the place I was supposed to be huh. Certainly, after sending everyone off, I trained alone in the bow.

This is no good. My mind went out somewhere in the low time that I can remain here.

“I feel that the captain (TN: changed president to captain) will get mad at me again” (Makoto)

To change my mood I sit down and decide to go with ‘hit in the middle’

Fire. Hit.

There is no opponent.

Continuing, another arrow. Hit.

The target in front of me is hit by my arrow. I take out the bamboo arrow and the shot arrow is remaining.

“Un, my condition is good” (Makoto)

Now that I think about it, it’s soon the time to change positions huh.

“The captain will most like be Higashi. I wonder who will become the vice-captain” (Makoto)

Mu. Again. My heart is noisy.

For my ‘hit in the middle’ to go far off is not something that happens often.

Why is it?

I place my bow aside for now and sit in seiza.

“Vice-captain. Vice-captain… was, me?” (Makoto)

I find the reason of my uneasiness.

What an incoherent thing.

I don’t remember wanting to be one though. Was I unexpectedly an ambitious person?

Then I should have aimed for captain at the very least. I am so small.

More like, the changing position has not occurred ‘yet’.

The senpais’ every year, before bon festival vacation, will announce the next captain and vice-captain. Probably inside the group they had decided this a long time ago though.

That is supposed to be the custom.

I look around the dojo.

I see a shadow that seemed to have slightly moved. But, when I try to look again there is no one. An optical illusion?

Well if no one has heard about it, then its fine though.

“fu…” (Makoto)

My feelings calm down.

The third shot was right in the middle. It pierced the arrow before it. Somehow, though.

Let’s finish this for today.

Unexpectedly deciding to finish ahead of time, I left with slight regret. If my condition was good I would have continued.

In my field of vision I see my tools receptacle.

I find there a personal bow that I am used to see.

That’s right, before finishing I would always use that one at least once. Why is it that I almost forgot to even do that?

An anxiety that drove uneasiness on me.

Holding the bow I pull the string. Compared to the one before, this one offers more resistance. However, that for me is more comfortable.

“Fu!!” (Makoto)

I unintentionally let out a voice from this sensation I haven’t felt for a long time. I have done this every day and yet why do I feel like this?

The arrow I shot in a place considerably far from the target, pierces it.

Damn. Even though I was always trying to miss it.

“No choice. Though taking it out is quite troublesome” (Makoto)

Breathing a sigh I head to recover the arrow, then after ending the troublesome job I put everything in order and finish changing.

Changing into my uniform again I finish inspecting and head for the exit.

In that place, a single girl was there.

—

“Senpai, otsukaresama (TN: thanks for your hard work today)”

The one who said this set phrase was my kohai.

I recall that she is the girl who joined late to our club. She is a really zealous person and has already reached the level of the new recruits. Rather, she has surpassed them.

After all, there aren’t many who have experience in archery before middle school. The one with experience says so.

“Ah, Hasegawa huh. What’s wrong? Did you stay here until now?” (Makoto)

“A, yes. I, before vacations, there was something I must… you know…” (Hasegawa)

“N? If it’s to hit the target you have already done it right?” (Makoto)

If I’m not mistaken, she told me she had such a goal.

But If I remember right, she has already achieved her goal in July, when she hit the head of the target.

In my eyes it was a fluke shot. And it wasn’t in the middle but just a hit.

Though, even if it was a fluke, it meant that she had reached the level where she could accomplish that. Her improvement was fast. At least she is a lot faster than me.

“No, it’s not that, a~… Don’t you know?!” (Hasegawa)

“About what? I don’t know at all. Aa, did you forget something?” (Makoto)

Hasegawa slightly droops her shoulders after hearing my words.

The girl hung her head down, her black hair that was tinted red by the light was swaying with the wind. Just like when I taught her about posture, her hair was put together in a side ponytail.

A pony tail will forever be one romance of us men, but a side tail also has a meaning to it.

Seeing the girl with a different style of hair, and helping me in a new thing I had though out, I unconsciously told her ‘it suits you’.

That she later faithfully always came in that same hairstyle made me remember the name of the girl.

The me who has short hair has not tried it before but with that hair of hers, doesn’t it hurt when she puts it up like that?

“Misumi-senpai” (Hasegawa)

The girl’s voice brings me back from my delusion mode.

“Un? What is it?” (Makoto)

If it’s some distress I have to help her resolve it. Of course, it has to be in the range of what I can do. As a senpai I want to show her my capacity.

“I have admired you for a long time. I like you. Please go out with me” (Hasegawa)

“??”

“??”

“??”

An incredible silence. Even though there should be miscellaneous sounds geez. I couldn’t feel or hear any of those.

… Yes?

What did this girl say?

Ihavealwaysadmiredyou?

Ilikeyou?

Pleasegooutwithme?

What am I even saying? I am not even that attractive. I want to say that the inside is but from the taste of people it would be faster to count them backwards. That kind of level.

Studying, well only in the subjects I like but I am regular at it.

Aside from archery, in physical ed. I am in the mid-top, no, right in the middle.

Moreover, the kohai in front of me is looking up to me, a bit, a bit!

A bit okay?!

However, in the club, especially this girl, shouldn’t have those kind of feelings for me though?

“Sen,pai?” (Hasegawa)

Timidly after the confession she raises up her lowered head. Hasegawa was looking at me fervently.

You have to look a bit more up, te! Now is not the time for that.

“Nonono. Wait, wait please” (Makoto)

I picture the situation. To be able to comprehend the present scenario I have to ask a number of questions to the girl. First, from the most important point.

“You, what you said the first day when you registered to the club, what was that?” (Makoto)

“That?” (Hasegawa)

“You certainly declared even though I didn’t asked, that you already had a boyfriend didn’t you? What was that? Are you telling me you already broke up with him?!” (Makoto)

“That was, before I entered the club, my friends told me of Ibuki-senpai. I thought I had to have some protection so I unintentionally…” (Hasegawa)

“It was a lie?!” (Makoto)

“Yes” (Hasegawa)

What encouraging words! I mean, to think her friends would be worried to the point of being cautious when she decided to join, all because of the bad friend of mine, Ibuki (tears)

“But you, when I tried to correct your posture you tried to hit me with the bow going ‘Hiaaaa!!!’ or something like that and screamed quite loudly” (Makoto)

That’s why for the sake of her not misunderstanding, I kept in mind to have the slightest amount of skinship with her.

At first I used the method of asking one of the girl members to teach her what I told her, but.

It would take the hands of double the people so I decided it was extremely pointless and stopped it.

To fall in love because of that?! No, that is impossible! If that was it I would already have a girlfriend by now!

How unpopular I am? Well, it is to the point that I want to seal it in my dark history. That’s how unpopular I know I am.

If I say it one by one I would end up standing here all day so I would like to refrain from it!

“That is, because you touched me so suddenly? So I unintentionally. Senpai came from behind me when my heart wasn’t prepared yet so…” (Hasegawa)

“A~I see, I am sorry. Hey, Hasegawa” (Makoto)

“Yes” (Hasegawa)

“I am sorry, I have no intention of going out with you. This may be old but I want to begin dating when I fall in love. That’s why if you suddenly tell me that I can’t accept it” (Makoto)

This opportunity may not come twice but, ‘I will like her after I date’, that kind of thinking I have some opposition to it.

If I love someone I will confess from my side and then if she accepts, I we will date. That’s how I like it.

I do think it’s stupid. Ibuki also tells me that a lot. Then if there is a girl that likes you and confesses to you, you will wait until you have the same feelings for her to confess and refuse all those girls? Is what he said.

‘What is wrong with falling in love while dating?’ those words he told me, I thought they were correct and I understand them but, no matter what, my feelings just won’t accept it. I am a fool.

“I don’t want!” (Hasegawa)

“Eeee?!” (Makoto)

What is with this turn of events?

This is not in my dictionary.

“Then its fine if it’s just a testing time! After that please fall in love with me! Is that no good senpai? Ma… Makoto-san!” (Hasegawa) (TN: to say your first name is a really kinky thing in Japan (lol))

Bufuwu!!!

What is with this god-like development? Game? What kind of love game is this?

Even with opportunism this is too much! This is way too convenient for the boy. With what taken into account did things become like this?!

I slightly panic.

“H-Hey Hasegawa! You, is that fine with you?!” (Makoto)

“Please call me Nukumi! Or is it that you… you actually already have another girl in your heart?!” (Hasegawa)

“No there is no such thing but…” (Makoto)

It was a little violent tone. To be pressured all the time is something like this huh.

Furthermore when I try to think for a bit and lower my head, a body that was developing well which I could tell even with her uniform on, I couldn’t just rudely look at it.

My sight was shifting to her breast!

In the end I had to talk with her while staring directly at her face.

“It’s okay right?! A test, if after that you reject me, I won’t cry so!” (Hasegawa)

That’s a lie! You will definitely cry with the current flow.

Uuhh…

I can’t reject her.

“Well, if you are really fine with it. But I want to hear one thing first. Why me? It’s sad for me to say it but, what did you fall for?” (Makoto)

“The appearance of senpai using the bow just like now” (Hasegawa)

“You were watching?!” (Makoto)

Nod.

“The first time I saw it, when you stayed last I would always watch you” (Hasegawa) (TN: dude that’s scary. Or is it only me?)

“… Then?” (Makoto)

“I thought it was incredibly beautiful. That moment, not only in the club, without having any interest in anything else, I practiced with the bow every day. To enter here I tried my very best so when I passed my objective suddenly vanished” (Hasegawa)

“??” (Makoto)

“Then, seeing senpai’s figure a number of times I…” (Hasegawa)

“You were watching me a number of times?!” (Makoto)

I didn’t even notice. What a blunder.

“I began thinking that I wanted to know more of this person. That’s why I entered the archery club” (Hasegawa)

So it was from the very beginning. To think my private enjoyment after training had been seen and moreover by someone who wasn’t even a member. From now restrain, can’t do it. Let’s just be more alert of my surroundings from now on.

“To tell you after I joined was… no good anymore so” (Hasegawa)

“I, I see. Thanks Hasegawa. I’m a little happy” (Makoto)

I stop the girl who tried to continue, with a word of gratitude. She felt something for me after watching me using the bow, this is the first time I have heard that from a girl from my own generation after all.

“Nu.Ku.Mi des!” (Hasegawa)

“I’m sorry. This isn’t something that can be fixed with effort. For now please forgive me. And for today just go back home. It’s late and dark already after all. The station is close to here so you should be fine right?” (Makoto)

It would be fine if I said that I would accompany her there but as expected I couldn’t say it.

“A, yes! Somehow, after saying it I feel refreshed. Senpai, in the summer vacations let’s play a lot okay?” (Hasegawa)

“Yeah. I am looking forward to it” (Makoto)

I wave at her. Suddenly I feel a creaking and uncomfortable feeling. I felt as if something inside me cried out loud.

I have been confessed ‘to’ for the first time in my life, an incredibly important event after all. In the middle of seeing her off, to feel a bit odd is not strange.

Well I haven’t ‘done it’ myself. For now. (TN: he is referring to confessing)

“Wa~ I was surprised. To think this would happen to me in my life” (Makoto)

Putting on my shoes I decide to finally leave the dojo.

“You are leaving pretty late Misumi”

At that place.

“Higashi” (Makoto)

The classmate that I think will most likely become the captain.

With her back leant to the outer wall she looked at me with a pretty awkward expression.

—-

“It is a bit surprising. Misumi has begun walking as well” (Higashi)

“Y, yeah” (Makoto)

Me and Higashi Azuma. From the gate of the school I accompany Higashi on the way home.

Without doubts she saw the life changing event that happened just now.

I felt that Higashi was unusually nervous, no doubt about it.

At this kind of moments what should I talk about, I seriously don’t know.

“I didn’t think I would happen to witness such a scene. When I am watching the guys from the club it is not something impossible but…” (Higashi)

Spilling a bitter smile Higashi looks at me. Her eye height should be the same as mine yet I felt like it was a bit higher right now. I am still in my teens so I still have room right?!

“But, I am sorry! I didn’t expect such a situation to happen to you! It’s not like I came here knowing it would happen so I’m truly sorry!” (Higashi)

“What’s bothering you is incredibly rude. Though it hurts that I can’t say anything against that!” (Makoto)

Mu~ I groan.

Now that I think about it.

Higashi must have something to talk to me about if she is waiting for me here. She is not the type to peak on others conversations so.

She has a candid boy-like personality. It’s not only because of that but it makes it easy to talk with her.

It’s an envious type that makes her popular to both men and women.

Even if I say so, her body is not thin but has a healthy looking style and makes me think that she looks womanly. Leaving the precocious-looking Hasegawa aside. I implore you, please share some height with me.

Well it’s not like being bigger is better. (TN: so many out of context in this chapter. Or is it just me?)

Her excellent style and her proportions being in the proper place style gives her a passing mark is what I think.

Inside of me, Higashi is viewed as an attractive girl. If there was a ranking of the ideal girl friends, within the school she would without doubt be in the tops.

By the way, there exists a secret ane-sama (TL: older sis) ranking and she placed second. That there were quite a lot of third years participating as well is the terrifying part. (TN: Because she is in second-year)

To make even the seniors yearn for her, hehe, let’s restrain here.

“Well, it’s okay. Then? Don’t you also have business with me?” (Makoto)

Umu? Wait a moment. That she also has some business, could it be?

I once again meet with the wrinkle. I can’t see it though.

“Well, yeah” (Higashi)

The voice of Higashi that seemed to have some hesitation. Her tone was also one level lower. Then is it what I thought?!

“Did you also see me while I was committing myself in ‘hitting the middle’?!” (Makoto)

“Ha?! What is it so suddenly? Well I have seen it though” (Higashi)

“Gupooo, I thought no one had seen it” (Makoto) (TN: no dud, being alone in a dojo after everyone is gone is pretty conspicuous if you ask me)

I was in agony. I was holding my head with both hands.

It was my secret time. For that reason I accepted to clean everything after everyone was gone!!

What a situation!!

Higashi is making a face like ‘what is it after so long’

I writhe even more!! I faint in agony!

“Well, occasionally. And it’s not like you closed up the dojo so there was no secret to begin with” (Higashi)

“But, the archery dojo is at the outskirts of the school you know? When the club activities finish and everyone goes home, there should be no one remaining?!” (Makoto)

“If someone forgot anything it would be busted in a second though” (Higashi)

“I properly make sure there is no such thing before I begin so there is no way” (Makoto)

“Why are you talking like a spoiled child? Even if there are no such things, there are persons that would come anyways thinking so right? More like, that is how it happened with me” (Higashi)

“Is your memory serving you right?!” (Makoto)

“Well I am a human after all” (Higashi)

Wu wu, I feel like I have been completely defeated.

“I will continue the conversation okay?” (Higashi)

The Higashi-san that looks like pitying me.

It’s okay, just continue what you wanted to say.

Surrendering, I nod. When I return home I will begin a new game. It would be good if it heals me.

“Today you see, before beginning the club activities. The senpais’ called me and told me if I wanted to be the next captain” (Higashi)

“And?” (Makoto)

What is she trying to tell me? More like, everyone thinks you are the number one candidate you know?

“And?! Can’t you have a bit more of a reaction than that?!” (Higashi)

“E?” (Makoto)

This time it was the turn of Higashi to get flustered. I wasn’t really trying to mess with her as I honestly answered her though. Because I could tell she was seriously speaking out.

In proportion to how bad my face is (That I am saying this feels really salty though) I am a black belt at reading the mood.

“Let me ask you in another way. Aside from you, who else can it be?” (Makoto)

“E, a, well that, umm, you maybe?” (Higashi)

There she suddenly shoots at me that is out of range.

“You know, I won’t be appearing in tournaments. I won’t be doing external matches, so what would happen to the top people of our club? Moreover, this club has always been succeeded by women” (Makoto)

That’s right. Aside from the fact that I won’t participate in matches, in our club for some reason the captain has always been a woman.

“You say that but I think you have the ability to overturn that though” (Higashi)

“Hey hey” (Makoto)

“Besides, the one that is most respected in the club is probably you” (Higashi)

“Hey hey hey!” (Makoto)

What is it, the Higashi today is unusually negative.

For a person that would cheerfully break a bamboo in two, for that girl, this is really unusual.

“It’s because those senpai don’t know true ability. I tried to recommend you but in the end they said that they want me to do it” (Higashi)

What kind of dangerous recommendation are you doing? That sort of discussion was not brought up to the other ane-samas (TN: older girls) so I was sure that would not happen though.

To think it was a paper thin chance. Live lazily lazily.

Is it my imagination, I could hear my cold sweat running down.

The two of us that were walking together are now in the middle of a long downhill. When we finish crossing this we arrive at the market area. There were lots of people passing by but we were the only ones who were returning from school at this time.

“Hey” (Higashi)

Higashi, saying that she turns her face to me.

When I turn to respond to her, she tightly holds both of my arms around the elbow with her two hands and Higashi turns my body to face her.

Of course, we face each other.

I felt that the strength of the two hands that held me had weakened a bit.

“Misumi. Would you please be the captain?” (Higashi)

“Higashi, I can’t do that. Just like how I thought of, everyone in the club also thinks that you would be the captain, we think you are able to” (Makoto)

“That, if Misumi just shows a round in front of everyone it should be fine! If you show them how you can pierce the previous arrow with another one they would all turn obedient!” (Higashi)

“Higashi!” (Makoto)

I was puzzled in what I should do but I shake off the hands of the girl that held me and conversely I take hold of both of her shoulders.

The body of the girl that was shaking slightly, the moment I held her she trembled heavily and then stopped. Her eyes seemed to grow slightly cloudy.

Sadly, I can’t choose the words that she wants to hear. That Higashi has the capacity to be the captain is clear after all. That’s why I have to give her self-confidence.

“This may sound mediocre but, I know that you can do it. The people around you will surely cooperate as well. No, I will make them do it! Anyhow, you, try doing it okay?” (Makoto)

“Really?” (Higashi)

Is she scared? I haven’t yelled at Higashi even once. More like, she was so excellent that there was no need to. A person that is fun to be beside with.

That’s right, this girl has never shown me her weak side. That’s why seeing the Higashi in front of me is a bit hard for me.

“Yeah, I assure you. Of course, I will be helping as well” (Makoto)

“Then, will you be the vice-captain?” (Higashi)

“A~ of course I wi- Ha?!” (Makoto)

“You will do it right?” (Higashi)

Was I set up?

Was I… used?

No, we are talking about Higashi. This must be how she really felt.

I feel that I can’t refuse at all. To refuse here is like trying to refuse the kings request and being caught in an infinite loop, that level of impossible!

“That’s cheap~ Yes yes, I will do it, vice-captain. In these long years to come, please take care of me, future leader” (Makoto)

“Heee~ then is it okay if I ask one more thing?” (Higashi)

With her still cloudy eyes she shows me a smile.

A creak. Again something is…

An alarm is ringing. And it’s even stronger than before. What is this?

“Hey, go out with me” (Higashi)

“A~ yes yes. Wait, waaaa?!” (Makoto)

“Aha! It’s good to try. Please take care of me, boyfriend~♫” (Higashi)

“Wa wa wa wa” (Makoto)

“What~ is it~?” (Higashi)

“Don’t ‘what is it?’ me! You were watching right?!” (Makoto)

The event where I was confessed to.

The answer of the uncool me and the ‘result’ of it.

“Yeah” (Higashi)

She gave me a really dull answer.

I don’t know, this kind of Higashi I have never seen it before. This is kind of ‘girly’ faced Higashi.

“But you are in a testing period with Hasegawa right? I don’t mind it you know?” (Higashi)

“Wa?!” (Makoto)

It’s like telling me I can two time.

That Higashi is? To the kohai that also confessed to me and is in the same club?

Creak, creak.

I felt a pain that was like if screwing inside my mind and the alarms that continued as if accompanying it.

This is wrong. This is not Higashi.

“This kind of thing never happened in reality!” (Makoto)

Again. The same feeling of being watched that I felt in the dojo. But there is something different!

“Don’t think that deeply about it. I and that girl are okay to just be tested. You can just freely taste us and then choose the one you like. I, if it’s Misumi I am okay with being second you know?” (Higashi)

With a refreshing face Higashi gently walks a step forward. To where I am. Her hands were placed on top of my chest. Did she bend her knees a little, her face closed on to my cheek.

Creak! Creak! Creak! Creak!

Yeah, it’s wrong!

The smell of Higashi’s hair instills a desire in me. But!!

This is wrong! It wasn’t ‘like’ this!

In reality.

In the memories inside of me!

It was something that had left a much more worse aftertaste.

Creak. The pain of the alarm weakens. In exchange, the surroundings began to wane. Is this the fault of the tears? No that’s not it!

It was a heavy memory but it was still an important one! It, It wasn’t a stupid thing like this!!

Hasegawa and Higashi.

They were stubborn, but they weren’t that resilient about it! The two people that I had hurt!

That’s why this is…

My head begins to knock. The alarm continues. But it’s weak. That’s right, that alarm is my reality.

“This is not my reality” (Makoto)

How frail, I am ashamed of the me that was played to this point.

To the me that must have wanted these two to do this kind of fools play, I am ashamed.

The tears that flowed from my regrets I wiped them off with my sleeves.

The world that was warping heavily.

To think this is an illusion.

I who had already understood the general situation am now firmly looking at the world around me once again.

There I am, just inside a deep, very deep mist.

“That wasn’t on the level of mirage. Damn it, damn it!!” (Makoto)

If I am a bit careless I will surely be swallowed by that illusion again. Next time with what kind of carnal desire, to which other person that I can’t meet anymore will I tarnish?

That kind of thing, I don’t want to see it again. I will not be able to take it.

But before I think of a clear way to get out of here. I have to hit the walls of this small world at least once or my heart won’t settle.

I have to clear away this regret and pitifulness. No, I can’t go without doing so.

“Shen, I thank you for reminding me of my pitifulness” (Makoto)

Without effort I find the wall. The walls that enclosed me in this deep mist.

I am sorry Ibuki. My important bad friend. I have always wanted to tell you something and because of my diffidence I wasn’t able to tell you.

But this is another world. In the words of another country to compare it to a well or the cavity of a tree wouldn’t be a problem right? (TN: I don’t understand what he is saying here clearly どこかの国で言うと井戸や木のうろに例えて問題は無いよね。)

The friend of mine in the previous world, the actions of him after seeing my shameful sights, float inside my mind.

Of course, I who was too ashamed to say anything made him as if he was in the wrong, the face of that me that I wanted to hit ‘also’ appeared inside of me.

“Anyways, you…!” (Makoto)

My passion was cooling down so I whispered the aria of brid multiple times.

“Calling out one girl after the other!!” (Makoto)

A red light revolves and envelops my right hand and forms a spherical shape. It may be my imagination but I felt that the power of this was a lot higher than the last time I used it.

It’s most likely because of the tension!!

I stand firm on the surface with my left leg as if trying to bring it down.

Using the way of shooting a straight I saw in a boxing manga as reference!

In my hand I carried the fire ball!

“I am already tired of your shit Ibukiiii!!!” (Makoto)

To my club friend, to the friend Ibuki that has received how many talents of heaven, along with all of my dissatisfaction, I with all of my strength hit the wall!!

——–

Explanation: Yeah, the chapter may not be very clear and its trying to be ‘mysterious’ in the past of MC. So what happened in reality we dont know yet.

But what happened here must have been REALLY, REALLY close to reality. For example: the part he was tricked into becoming a vice-captain or when he was confessed. It may all have been true except for the parts where even after rejected they still continued attacking.

Now the relationship of Ibuki and MC that everyone is having issues with. Ibuki is a bad friend of MC. He laughed at MC’s misery every time he had the chance. He is also a womanizer and is a very talented person so MC doesn’t like him and I don’t either. The end 🙂

A mysterious existence. Mysterious experiences. Mysterious memories.

To think about destroying this would be a stupid thing to do.

Trapping him in the mist barrier. While I was checking out the memories of the enemy hyuman I was shocked.

By the way, I don’t know what kind of illusion he is being shown. I just pour in the power inside this barrier and can only decide if the direction of the illusion will be pleasure or fear.

Normally after that there wouldn’t be any problems. If it goes into the fear side most of them would die and a lot of them would also struggle. If its pleasure, the struggle would be low but the time it takes for them to die would get longer.

For speed its fear, for safety I would go for pleasure. That’s how I divided the use of them.

But this time, to have chosen this method made me feel terribly ashamed.

This memories are wonderful. Just, wonderful.

This enemy, no, this man, it was hard to believe but, he was someone that had come from another world.

Memories can’t lie. There is no source more truthful than this.

An unknown existence unknown existence unknown existence.

Even with my long time here I have never seen such memories before, he was a person of great interest.

To let this living being to die. Such a thing is something that shouldn’t be done.

Especially, this.

This that seems to be one of the hobbies of this man.

It jolted my heart with a tremendous force.

I don’t want these memories that seemed like I had cut them off, I don’t want dead memories.

I want memories that are alive. I want to hear it directly from him. And I want to converse with him.

In his strength, his treasures, his existence.

I don’t remember a time where my heart has been moved so much. Is this what they call interest?

It wasn’t just a whim, from the bottom of my heart I knew that this was interest.

I don’t want to lose him.

I want to know. That’s why I won’t let this person die.

I have to release him. To enclose him in a dangerous barrier is a foolish thing to do.

The moment I release him I should talk with him.

For the sake of that, what should I do?

I have to let him know that I don’t feel hostility for him anymore.

Using a word from his world it would be, show your stomach and everything will be understood?

I don’t understand.

But, first of all I should release him and then ask for his state. If he is surprised I should be able to use that as a trigger to begin a conversation.

I have already learned human words. There should be no problem.

Though, he can speak with the orcs so he should be able to speak with me as well.

“Then” (Shen)

Thinking I should release the barrier, I look at it. Anyhow, it’s my first time that I have been this entranced in a person’s memories so.

What a sweet feeling.

But once again, I was the one who ended up being surprised.

Inside the barrier I could sense the activation of power.

It was quite the power.

I can hear something.

“Anyways… girls… after the other!” (Makoto)

What is it, the power has increased even more. The barrier is crying.

“Already… tyr…. kiiiiii!!!” (Makoto)

“Oooh?!” (Shen)

The mist that was in the surface of the barrier disappeared as if crying.

And then.

A dull and dreadful sound rose out, my barrier, for the first time, had been destroyed from the inside.

How out of the standard can you be? Just how powerful is that power that the God from the other world has given you?

Cold sweat.

Thinking about that attack hitting me send shivers down my body.

Showing my stomach, I prepare myself to round my eyes the best way possible. (TN: Yeah I imagine her going all kawaii mode) To how lovely I can look, I don’t have much confidence though.

Most likely he thinks of me more in the animal class. Not the pet type but the wild animal class. To what extend I can look as a caring animal, I am a bit insecure.

And then, he appeared.

“Hey” (Makoto)

In a really calm voice he calls me out and my body hardens.

“I am sorry, good man that has come from another world. I now know the circumstances of the destruction of the gate. I have learned that it was a misfortunate accident. I will also apologize for my quick temper. Could you please lower you weapon?” (Shen)

“Wa?” (Makoto)

“I will add this to my apology, I have read your memories. I don’t know the contents but that I have shown you an unpleasant illusion, I apologize from the bottom of my heart” (Shen)

“… That wasn’t something you had shown me?” (Makoto)

“I can choose if it will be pleasure or pain but the details and the contents are dependent on the target” (Shen)

When I answered him like this, he crouched while holding his head. ‘So it’s as I thought~’ is what he groaned.

“Other world person, I am Shen. A superior dragon and an existence that is called “invincible”. Just as you know, I am particularly good at illusions” (Shen)

I made a decision that would make the me from yesterday laugh.

“A, I see… I am Misumi Makoto. If I said Misumi Makoto would you understand? (TN: he says it twice. One in kanji and the other in hiragana. I wish he would use Hiragana for names more often) You may already know but I have come from another world” (Makoto)

I already knew but him saying it shocks me for a second. To watch memories is deep that’s for sure. For the sake of the future this is something that must be said.

“Makoto-dono, won’t you sign a pact (TN: I will use pact instead of contract) with me?” (Shen)

I have already decided to follow this man. I already know that he is close to a traveler and that he is aiming to head to human settlement. A human settlement, it was more like he was looking for people.

Then a pact is fine.

I will follow him as a partner.

I will lent him my power and I want him to talk to me about his experiences. Especially about ‘that’

“Uh? A pact? Like a summoning beast?” (Makoto)

“It’s an event that can only be done one-on-one, it vaguely differs depending on circumstances. The existences that are in my class most likely can only do this once. I can brag about me being the strongest class. I promise you that I will not bring any loses to you!” (Shen)

His way of seeing things may be a bit different but it must still be pretty similar.

“N? To have more people along is better?” (Makoto)

“Yes! Yes! I am extremely interested in your hobbies! Please do give me a favorable answer!” (Shen)

Yes, those wonderful memories. With just a glance they captured everything of me.

“Guha!! What kind of threat is that?! What did I get my hands on?!” (Makoto)

For some reason he was crouching and agonizing.

“How is it? I think it’s something that will bring benefits for both of us though” (Shen)

“Gugugugu, you schemer. Alright, I get it! I will be counting on you” (Makoto)

“Yes! I as well in the many years to come, I will be counting on you!” (Shen)

With his approval I began the process of the pact with me as the lead. He doesn’t know the process of it so it’s a matter of course.

A pact of 50-50. This is absurd, the configuration I am trying to push is not maintaining at all. How out of the standards.

A 70-30 parent and child pact. Impossible, this is also pushed away. Just how much maryoku does he have?

An 80-20 ruling pact. I was somehow able to retain the configuration. To think I would be pressured down to this point. My pride as a superior dragon is a bit hurt.

I can’t maintain my consciousness any longer. This is the first time I think that being a dragon is a good thing.

A ruling pact, in essence I would be his familiar, no, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that I am his slave.

Fufufufu. Isn’t that fine.

I am looking forward to what he, no, that great person will do in the future.

It seems that in the next hundred or less years.

It will be the most fun times I will have in my whole life.

Being liberated from my boredom, I felt my heart shaking in joy.

“Then once more, please take care of me, my master, Misumi-sama” (Shen)

TN: Slave get! I mean, Harem member +1!

An easy to translate chapter with not as many idioms as in the last chapter.

I really wish the other chapters are like this.
