~Side Ryouma~

…What’s wrong? For some reason, after I answered their question, everyone – especially the Jamil family – looked at me with scary eyes.

Did I do something bad?

“Magnificent.” [Reinbach]

Huh? What’s magnificent?

“That’s amazing, Ryouma-kun! You’ve actually solved a mystery that has been plaguing monster tamers for ages!” [Elize]
“!?” [Ryouma]

What’s wrong with these people!? Their eyes are sparkling and they’re way too enthusiastic for some reason… This is actually scary!

“Madam, Reinbach-sama, please calm down. You’re scaring Ryouma-sama.” [Butler]
“Ah! Sorry about that, dear. I didn’t mean to scare you.” [Elize]
“Sorry. I got a lil too excited there.” [Reinbach]
“It’s alright…” [Ryouma]
“Let me explain what has these two so excited. The explanation you gave us just now regarding why monster tamers couldn’t tame a big slime happens to be one of the mysteries that has been plaguing monster tamers.

Big slimes aren’t strong, but they’re hard to fight, so there were a lot of people who tried to tame one. In fact, you still see some people trying from time to time, but of course, no one’s ever succeeded.” [Reinhart]
“Out of pride, many monster tamers tried to uncover the reason preventing the contract from working, but they couldn’t get any results. In the end, their research labs were cut, and though there are still those who research them to this day, no one has managed to succeed… At least, until you, anyway.” [Reinbach]

Uwaah… This has unexpectedly turned into something crazy.

“Mu~, what a weak reaction… Let me put it this way. The research on big slimes has been going on since roughly the very same day the arts of monster taming spread through the world.

It’s an unsolvable mystery so unsolvable that people don’t expect anyone to get results. In fact, it’s treated by research labs as a waste of time. And yet that supposedly unsolvable mystery that has made many researchers surrender was solved by you! Can you still remain so calm knowing this!?” [Elize]

You’re kidding, right? This was just a coincidence. Damn, this looks like trouble. What to do?

“What should I do?” [Ryouma]
“Leave a record in the tamer guild and announce your findings!” [Elize]

Ah~ So they had an organization that gathered information on this sort of stuff. Judging from the reactions of these people, it looks like it’ll get me a lot of attention if I announce it though. Oh, but this might be a good opportunity to leave the forest…

“Town, huh…” [Ryouma]

When those words slipped out of my mouth, the people of the Jamil Family and the servants reacted.

“Oh, I’m sorry. I forgot you don’t like towns…” [Elize]
“We won’t force you to record and announce your findings, but this is really one hell of a find, kid. I just want you to know that.” [Reinbach]
“I, understand. Ah…” [Ryouma]

After the slimes fused and entered, the path was finally traversable.

“In any, case, let’s enter, first.” [Ryouma]

There are beasts prowling outside, it wouldn’t do to stay out here for too long.

I led everyone into the house, then I left to prepare black tea for everyone. The black tea I had were looted from the bandits that attacked me in the past. They had a lot of the same brand, so it’s probably stolen goods. I only found out I had them when I went to look for a spear to give to Hyuzu-san.

I didn’t know since I’d already forgotten about the bandits’ stuff. I had no need for money and I wasn’t fond of stolen goods, so I just left them alone, but… If I’d known there were tea among the loots, I would have brought them out sooner.

Anyway, I brought out the best-looking tea leaves. They don’t seem to have expired yet, so it should be fine. The only problem were the cups and the chairs. I didn’t have enough for 12 people, so I had to quickly make some with earth magic.

I made the tea with the ingredients I got two days ago. One ingredient was the honey I got from a bee’s nest, and the other was a ginger I treated with lemon-style syrup. They were all I had to substitute sugar with, so I hope the guests like them.

“Sorry to… keep you waiting. Please have, some black tea.” [Ryouma]
“Oh, my. Thank you.” [Elize]
“That’s a good smell.” [Reinhart]
“Hmm… You seem to have some good tea leaves with you.” [Reinbach]
“It’s from the bandits… who attacked me. I have a lot, more of them.” [Ryouma]
“I see… It’s good.” [Reinbach]
“Indeed.” [Elize]
“You’ve really managed to bring out the aroma of the tea leaves too. Ryouma-sama, where did you learn to make your tea?” [Butler]

‘From another world’ is not something I could obviously say.

“Grandma… Taught me.” [Ryouma]

Grandparents = Omnipotent.

I really have to thank the gods for them. If I had to make up a lie on my own, I would surely be found out. I was often called ‘stupid honest’ back in my previous life – not that I agree with them. But, in any case, since all I’m doing now is using the setting that the gods prepared for me beforehand – a setting they prepared by summoning the souls of my grandparents and getting their permission – I don’t feel like I’m lying at all. I’m really thankful for it.

“There’s more, honey, if you’d like…” [Ryouma]
“Thank you.” [Elize]
“Let me have some too. Honey is a luxury, so it’s a pretty rare occasion to get to taste it.” [Hyuzu]
“Wait a moment, Hyuzu-san!” [Camil]
“I got the honey from, a bee’s nest two days ago. It’s free, anyway, so… Camil-san, please have, some.” [Ryouma]
“Huh, really? Then in that case, I’ll have a little.” [Camil]
“Heh, you’re not so different from me, are ya?” [Hyuzu]

Around that time the young lady of the Jamil Family – Elialia I believe – noticed something as she drank her tea.

“Oh? It seems it’s not only honey. There’s something else mixed in.” [Elialia]

The butler immediately went to check.

I wonder if they don’t like the jija (ginger) and the lamon (lemon-like fruit).

“I can taste the juice of lamon. It’s a refreshing taste, however, that’s not all.” [Butler]

Fortunately, they don’t think it’s poison.

I decided to reveal the mystery. After all, it wasn’t like I added poison or anything.

“I also added, jija root.” [Ryouma]
“Oh, so this is jija. I thought it was just a salty vegetable. Who knew it could be used to draw the flavor out like this?” [Elialia]
“…Jija can be, used in cooking… Can remove the odor, of meat and fish…” [Ryouma]
“That is good information. Thank you, Ryouma-sama. I shall inform the master chef as soon as we return.” [Butler]
“You’re welcome.” [Ryouma]
“Now then – before I completely forget – we came here to thank you for your help last time. Please accept our gifts. Sebasu.” [Reinhart]
“Yes, Reinhart-sama. ‘Item Box’.” [Sebasu]

When Reinhart-san mentioned about the gifts, the butler behind him stood up and invoked a spell. Suddenly, an empty circle appeared from thin air. The butler, Sebasu, extended his hand inside and took out something.

Item Box
As the name implies, it’s a dimensional-type spell that creates a new dimension to store items in. It’s a difficult spell but also one of the basics of dimension magic. I can use it too, but I can’t put that many items in mine.

On the desk in front of me, upon which was a bucket full of fruits, came falling down countless rolls of paper and cloth.

“That’s, a lot.” [Ryouma]
“I didn’t know what would make you happy, so I brought various goods. Please accept them.” [Reinhart]

Reinhart said as he opened the rolls.

Inside the rolls were preserved food, clothes, writing tools, mana stones for lighting, clocks that moved via mana… all sorts of stuff, each and every single one of which were practical things that my house lacked.

It seems he took his time considering what my house was lacking.

“I just eye-balled the clothes, so try them out first. If they’re too big… Arone, Lilian.” [Reinhart]
“Yes.” [Arone, Lilian]
“You can ask these two to help you.” [Reinhart]

I was wondering why they would bring their maids with them to a place like this, as it turns out, they’re here to ensure the clothes fit.

I felt kind of bad, so it was fortunate that the clothes didn’t need much changes.

I should thank them.

“Thank you, very much. You brought, so much.” [Ryouma]
“Don’t sweat it. They’re not that expensive, and besides, we also have something to do around these parts.” [Reinhart]
“Something, to do?” [Ryouma]
“Remember when I said that we’re a family of monster tamers? My daughter, Elia, has been studying all this time. Now that she’s of age, she needs to tame her first monster, a slime.” [Reinhart]

Her first monster, huh. Since he mentioned ‘age’ that must mean that she hasn’t been permitted to until now. Well, monsters are alive, so she would have to take care of it and it’s also a little dangerous. It’s only natural her parents wouldn’t allow her until she’s old enough.

“Congratulations.” [Ryouma]

When I said that, the young lady drinking tea smiled and said ‘thank you’.

Since she’s yet to tame her first monster, I might as well lend her a hand.

“We’ve been looking all this time, but we’ve yet to find a single slime.” [Elialia]
“Slimes are monsters too, they’re living beings. There are times when you just can’t find one.” [Reinbach]
“…Then, how about, here.” [Ryouma]

I stood up and pointed on the map of the forest on the wall.

“River. There should be, lots of slimes, here.” [Ryouma]

It was a river not too far from the house. It’s where I get my water from, and in fact so do the wild slimes.

If they look around it, they should be able to find a couple.

For the record, when I went to get water once, I managed to catch 14 slimes. Of course, that was only a one-time thing.

When I said that, the young lady’s face beamed, and after getting her parents’ permission, she asked me something.

“Can I call you Ryouma-san?” [Elialia]
“Please.” [Ryouma]
“Then Ryouma-san, if it’s no trouble, could you teach me which slime to pick.” [Elialia]
“Which, to pick?” [Ryouma]
“Yes. I only need one slime, but there’s probably a lot out there. I’m not so sure which one I should tame.” [Elialia]

Ah, so that’s what she meant. There’s no good or bad slime, though…

“In that case… You should pick out your slime, according to what kind you, want it to evolve into. It will, take a lot of time, though…. If you want strength, a different monster, would be preferable. If you don’t have want to raise, the slime for long, you don’t need to think, too much… Do you, still want a slime?” [Ryouma]
“Yes, it will be my first monster, so I intend to treasure it forever.” [Elialia]

What a pure face. Well, if it’s her, she probably will treasure it. I should help her.

Hmm? Why do I think she would treasure it if it’s her?

I don’t think I’ve ever thought like this before.

Am I being fooled? Could I be interested in her? A mentally-wise over 40-years-old uncle like me?

Stop. Let’s not think too much.

“Umm, is it not possible?” [Elialia]

I don’t mind teaching her, but the way I’m talking right now sure is a pain. It would be great if I could talk smoother.

“If you’re alright with me, sure, but… Only 3 types, can be currently chosen.” [Ryouma]
“Why only 3?” [Elialia]
“One of the evolution conditions is, unknown; the other one, I don’t have enough food; the other one, doesn’t suit, women… That last one would, actually be the best ability-wise, though…” [Ryouma]
“Can I have a moment?” [Elize]

While I was talking with the young lady of the Jamil Household, the madam interjected. She had a serious look on her face.

“Mother, I am currently talking with Ryouma-san. This is important for my first contract, so please don’t interfere.” [Elialia]
“I know that but there’s something bothering me. Ryouma-kun, if I’ve been hearing correctly, it seems you actually know the evolution conditions for the slimes?” [Elize]
“More or less.” [Ryouma]

As I thought, the madam muttered, then she turned to Reinhart-san, who promptly lightly shook his head.

(I didn’t hear about this!)
(I only heard he was researching!)

Well, that’s probably what they were saying with their gestures.

“Could it be, this is another mystery, like the big slime?” [Ryouma]
“Yes. Slimes can be found anywhere, but no one actually knows anything about them. You should be more careful who you teach those conditions to.”[Elize]

I thought it was fairly simple though.

But then again, even Japan has its own share of mysteries.

If I ever get the opportunity, I would like to talk to those slime researchers.

But that’s still in the future. I need to figure out what to do with the present first.
