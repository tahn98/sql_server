INSERT INTO `chapter`(`book_id`,`name`,`data`,`number_of_read`,`upload_date`) VALUES(2,'chapter 1','After sleeping as much as he needed, when he woke up and came to the kitchen, a meal (breakfast by feeling) prepared by the angel was producing steam on the table.
The angel herself wasn’t there, but he wasn’t surprised since she said that meeting her at all was a strange thing in itself and there won’t be many times to meet her in the future.

“It’s delicious.”

Now that he became alone, he was touched at something very trivial. Moreover, it wasn’t empty words when he said it was delicious. He felt sorry but it was definitely more delicious than his mother’s food. The meal was nutritiously balanced and at the same time tasty, so it was a perfect meal.

“And if she earns a lot of money, then she’ll be number one wife material.”

Who married angels? Other angels, as expected, right? – While thinking trivial things like that, he was about to wash the dishes, when the dishes disappeared silently. It seemed that washing dishes was a service.
Yu IlHan washed up and clothed himself while feeling as if he was seduced by the angel, and when he was about to wear his socks to go to college, he remembered that there was nothing he could do there and stopped.

“Well, then.”

What to do now.

The answer revealed itself soon. Didn’t the angel say to train his body? Although the cells would not age, they were still active, so if he trained, the result will be reflected on his body.

He honestly didn’t like moving his body. He had no athletic ability, and he had no good memories in regards to things related to sports.
In his middle school athletic meet relay, the baton slipped from his hands and the baton ended up touching the PE teacher’s wig rather than the next player. – There was one such good…. good memory!

However, to use that as an excuse like a little child and avoid training, the situation was too serious.

Won’t monsters appear in just 10 years? I can’t practice mana like the rest of humanity so I need to do whatever I can do to raise my strength.

‘Going to the gym, eh…’

After deciding, Yu IlHan stood up and sighed. He decided to train his body, so it was now time to research materials on how to efficiently train.

After investing half a day to look up how to train the muscles, whisking away the lunch(by feeling) on the table, he left. The district gym was open as if it was obvious, and numerous workout machines greeted Yu IlHan.

“Fuu.”

Yu IlHan, who now slightly, just slightly, had motivation sighed and approached the bike which would burn his body fat.
It was the beginning of Yu IlHan’s body modification.

Yu IlHan went to the gym without complaining at all.
For 3 years.

[Are you really a modern person? How can you do the same thing everyday for 3 years?]

It was to the point that the angel showed up and asked him.

“But I need to do it, though.”
[You do.]
“That’s why I’m doing it. It’s not much different from studying for 3 years in high school.”
[……]

The angel looked at Yu IlHan as if looking at a monster.
As the angel said, he didn’t age, but Yu IlHan’s body, after consuming sufficient nutrition and doing exercises too much, was developed to the point that he looked like a health trainer that appeared on TVs. Well, it was quite obvious since he didn’t study at all and trained all day.

[You aren’t an ordinary person. Although, I knew that when you had the concealment technique which could hide you from God’s sight.]
“Don’t make it my fault!”

And he went to the gym for 2 more years. The period of time the angel promised him was 10 years so he had 5 years left now. At this point, he was sick and tired of going to the gym every day.

“I have to learn some martial arts and some weaponry right?”
[There’s no one to teach you though?]

Although she said that there won’t be many meeting in the future, she showed herself quite frequently and perhaps she got used to Yu IlHan but she was not polite with him anymore. If one didn’t consider the feathery wings on her back, then she was just a beautiful big sister, so he didn’t feel bad at all about her attitude

“I don’t know why, but internet and electricity is still working so I will study by myself by looking at some videos on y*utube or something.”
[Well, time stopped after all.]
“You’re keep going to using that excuse right?”
[Yup.]

Yu IlHan stopped staring at the angel and heaved out a sigh.

“If you recommend me one, then what would it be?”
[Vale Tudo and spearmanship. Well, I don’t think there will be much records about training in the spear so, train the basics until you die.]
“I said one!”
[Isn’t there 5 years? Just get the basics down for both.]

And what? Vale Tudo was a systematic martial art in the first place?! Yu IlHan, who was about to complain to the angel, changed his mind when he saw her serious face.
It wasn’t like she was teasing him. She advised him with the martial arts that would actually help when the earth experienced the Great Cataclysm.

Then he had no choice. If it was the angel’s recommendation, he had to follow. Yu IlHan muttered to himself in his heart and woke his body up.
The light body movements. His changed body made him feel the time.

At first, he was really sad and lonely, but when he lived for a while, he now got used to it. Isn’t human adaptation ability amazing?
Eating and sleeping was solved and there was something he had to do every day. Moreover, there was an angel that chatted with him from time to time. Other than the moments he thought of his mother, and became sad, it was doable.

‘I need to endure for 5 years. Just 5 years. Let’s endure until then.’

With that thought, Yu IlHan sat his grown body in front of the computer. He thought that Vale Tudo and spearmanship were difficult to learn just from the internet, but he had 5 years. He just thought that it was possible for him to do it if it was just getting the basics down.

The first 2 years were a continuation of trial and error. He did train his body but to Yu IlHan, who hadn’t fought with other people before, Vale Tudo was like a girlfriend to him. It only existed inside monitors.

In contrast, there was some progress in spearmanship. Yu IlHan, who didn’t know the ‘m’ of martial arts, used a long wooden stick instead of a spear to repeat motions of stabbing, swinging and blocking. But when it became 1 year and 2 years, his spear had some weight. Yu IlHan gained some enlightenment.

‘Martial arts in the end is the same as studying.’

Even something undoable would become doable when repeated a lot. That belief led him higher. It was the same for studying, training his body, and now, it was the same for spearmanship.

Then wouldn’t Vale Tudo be the same? Yu IlHan, who barely succeeded grabbing the edge of martial arts, started looking for books and videos more enthusiastically and got more absorbed in training Vale Tudo and spearmanship.

When he decided that he would do it, there was some progress. In the first place, Vale Tudo was basically a practical fighting technique to kill the enemy without any rules whatsoever. While researching into other martial arts books and videos, and putting effort to learn it with his body, Yu IlHan slowly, very slowly, felt like he had grabbed something.

Spearmanship too – He started considering the body movement that rather than just stabbing and swinging.
Pre-attack movement, post-attack movement. Movement to enhance attack power. His steps improved, and his spear phases developed and his eye direction developed. It was a positive change that occurred while learning Vale Tudo.

Yu IlHan’s muscles, which developed unilaterally, developed in a more battle-oriented way due to the martial arts training. It was to the point that when 8 years passed since he was left out, the angel was shocked after seeing him.

[You didn’t eat some strange drug right?]
“What are you taking my efforts as?!”
[Such a surprising human. Or are all humans like this?]
“Leave me alone.”

The problem Yu IlHan had was that he had no opponents. He had to fight with others to know how much his techniques worked, what was wrong, and what should be fixed. How much longer does he have to practice on sandbags and beanbags?

On the 9th year of being left out and 4th year of training martial art, Yu IlHan thought that. It was something he could think of since he was more and more confident in his techniques. Fighting with others – If it was the him from 9 years ago, he would be scared senseless and run away. Or call the police.

[You know?]

With those words, the angel pointed to herself. Yu IlHan asked in doubt

“You want me to hit you? Angel-noona?”
[Even though I might look like this, I’m an envoy of God and a higher existence. So I’m unimaginably stronger than you think.]
“You know what Vale Tudo is, right?”

Vale Tudo was literally merciless practical combat. It was a combat technique that made one wonder if it was not about incapacitating the opponent but killing the opponent. Of course, he was only on his 4th year, but Yu IlHan knew how lethal of an effect it would have if he used it on humans.

[Fuu. It was me who told you to practice that. Don’t worry and come at me.]
“Is it really okay? You won’t say otherwise later right?”
[Of course.]

The angel smacked her uselessly large chests and assured him. Yu IlHan looked at her and after resolutely deciding his heart, he went at the angel with wide eyes.

“Eat my fist containing the resentment of 9 year of isolation! Diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeee!”
[Fuu.]

And he got beaten up miserably. The angel was a Vale Tudo star.

[You know now? You can consider me a fighting opponent as you want. It’s the biggest service since the birth of angels!]
“No…….!”

After getting beaten up and getting bruises all over his body, Yu IlHan rejected with all his might, but unfortunately he didn’t have the rights to refuse. It was because the angel truly wanted to help him survive after the Great Cataclysm after seeing him train seriously for 9 years.
From Yu IlHan’s view, it wasn’t very welcome, but even if he wanted to run away, he couldn’t run away from that angel.

Fighting with the angel made his techniques truly rise rapidly. He didn’t want to admit it, but his growth was too distinct. I want to stop feeling this pain and hit that woman no matter what it takes! – since this was his objective for moving his body.
The angel was proud and Yu IlHan was in pain. His techniques in Vale Tudo and spearmanship increased.

Until the promised 10 years came.

Yu IlHan took a shower, shaved himself, and looked at his figure on the mirror. His body was strong to the point that he would be able to fight with a wolf due to training his body for 10 years, but his face was still the college freshman from 10 years ago. so there was a strange disharmony.

“It would be good if I was a bit taller.”
[Wouldn’t you grow after the Great Cataclysm? Your face is a bit disappointing but your body figure is fine so if you grow a bit taller…… Hmhm. It might not be half bad.]
“What was that about my face!?”

He looked at the mirror. Eyes that were not big at all, loose eyebrows, nose that wasn’t high at all, slightly pale lips, and even more pale skin. Hmm. he couldn’t deny that he had a face that lacked vitality.
But this was his own face. A unique face in the world.

[You engraved that much techniques into your body, so you will be able to confront low class monsters without difficulty. If so, you will level up smoothly too. So you will be able to handle mana soon.]

The angel said. She was slightly disappointed as she was preparing for a farewell, but Yu IlHan asked back since there was something that he had a question about.

“How can I kill those monsters? I thought you said you can’t kill them without mana.”
[That’s about high class monsters made up entirely of a higher system of energy, low class monsters can be killed by guns or spears or knives easily, though?]
“You deceived me angeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeellllllllllll!”
[Fufuu. I didn’t lie. You just didn’t ask for details!]

The angel proudly held out her chest and blabbed. This woman, was a naughty woman who boasted sexual appeal whenever she could – Even with a messy mind, Yu IlHan thought of these things.

His rage was boiling, but it calmed down after some time passed. In the end, it was a deceit for him to grow stronger. She put in effort to fill the gap of not being able to handle mana.
When he thought of it like that, he couldn’t get angry and instead, all the energy left his body.

“Ordinary college life would be impossible, right?”
[Of course. The majority of society will be paralyzed. And a period where fighting ability rather than academic ability will be needed will come.]
“Phew……”
[When a dropout appeared at first, I thought the skies were collapsing, but due to your effort, I didn’t have to worry much. You worked hard until now. You will do well in the future.]

The time came. It was the same time as 10 years ago. Of course, Yu IlHan himself couldn’t tell the time so the angel told him.
Yu IlHan purposely moved to the same place. The grassy plaza inside the college campus. It was a scene he hadn’t seen for 10 years but there was no difference.

“Thank you for everything until now, angel-noona.”
[Wow.]

It was the first time he said thank you. The angel also didn’t seem to think that she would receive thanks and was flustered for a bit, but in the end, she laughed and flapped her wings and came to his side.

[It was quite a fun 10 years thanks to you too.]
“Will I be able to see you again?”
[Well, that will depend on you.]

The angel spoke until there, and hesitated for a bit before adding another line.

[My name is Lita.]
“Lita.”

Yu IlHan kept muttering her name as if he didn’t want to forget it. The angel, Lita, watched such a figure in satisfaction before flapping her wings again.

[I have to go. Time on Earth will resume soon, and the people will come back.]
“Have a safe trip, Lita-noona.”

The two bid their farewells. Lita slowly flew up to the sky and Yu IlHan tried his best to suppress his disappointment due to the farewell with Lita, and the excitement of going back to his ordinary life from 10 years ago, and closed his eyes.

Nothing happened.

“……”

Yu IlHan opened his eyes. He could see Lita in panic in the air.

“……Care to explain?”

Yu IlHan said with a quiet voice. Lita slowly came down to the ground and laughed cutely with a ‘teehee’. And spoke.

[I think there was a mistake.]
“Hey you crazy XXXXXXXX!”
[Perhaps due to stopping the time or some other reason, there seems to be a slight deviation in the time axis. It’s alright. It won’t be much so if you endure 10 or 20 more years……]
“Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh.”

It’s that f*cking time again! Yu IlHan went on a rampage while rolling on the grass square. It was because he knew that he would be beaten up if he went against the angel.
Like that, Yu IlHan, who calmed down after putting grass all over his body, muttered while looking at the resentful blue sky.

“Good. It’s just 10 or 20 years. I will wait no problem.”

Humans are animals of adaptation. He did well until now so he would do well in the future – The positive attitude, which was his only good trait about him, but became one of many now, persuaded himself.

However, even after 10 years and 20 years, humanity didn’t come back.
And when 50 years passed, Yu IlHan stopped counting time.
',0,'2019-05-01 23:00:01.000000');
INSERT INTO `chapter`(`book_id`,`name`,`data`,`number_of_read`,`upload_date`) VALUES(2,'chapter 2','At first, he also put in his efforts. He had thought that he need to prepare for whatever he could since he didn’t know when humanity would come back.

“Vale Tudo and spearmanship are still sloppy. Actually, it’s better for me!”
[Such a strange human…….!]

Even while receiving Lita’s strange gaze, Yu IlHan immersed himself again in training. Lita provided all 3 meals for him anyway so he only needed to think about the martial arts that he needed to learn.

And like that, 5 years and 10 years passed. It was the moment after 20 years had passed since he was left out.

Now, his punches and kicks flowed with fighting spirit that can even kill a bear, much less a human, and the wooden spear he extended powerfully not only pierced the sandbag, but it ripped it apart. Yu IlHan himself thought that he had no talent in regards to martial arts, but growing up like this in just 15 years was amazing. Of course, it was also because Lita, who was a great fighting partner, was there for him.

“I’m turning 40 soon. How is it? Do I look more mature?”
[The only thing you did was punching and stabbing with the spear. Do you think you earned anything other than enlightenment in martial arts? Did you see anyone acting their age after coming out from training in the mountains?]
“You think so too? My mom won’t tell me I’m pretending to be mature, right?”
[Don’t worry about it and keep training.]

From this point, Lita, who came once a week, came once in 3 days. It was because she was worried that Yu IlHan might go crazy after being alone in the huge prison known as Earth for no less than 20 years.

Whether it was due to her worry and interest or due to his innate personality, Yu IlHan endured well.
He endured for 20, 30 years.

[Just how much did it deviate!]

While looking at such Yu IlHan, it was now Lita who was nervous to the point of shouting. However, Lita’s position wasn’t actually that high so she wasn’t in a position to ask God directly, and she didn’t have the rights to reverse the time axis so she could only restlessly watch Yu IlHan training his body quietly, day by day.

“Lita.”

One day, Yu IlHan said with a lowered voice.

“I can’t remember my mom’s face.”
[……I’m sorry.]
“Even when I look at the picture, it feels unfamiliar. Was this person really my family? Wasn’t I living here alone in the first place? Everything was my delusion and it is a lie that Lita made in order to console me……”
[Don’t say such things!]
“Yeah, it was a joke. It might be good if it was actually like that though.”

He sighed and took back the spear. It was the time after 50 years of being left behind.

“I’m fed up. I want to do something else.”
[I’m sorry to say this now but…… It’s not known when the Great Cataclysm will occur. You cannot neglect your martial arts.]
“I know.”

Now that they had shared several tens of years together, racial matters such as being an angel or being a human didn’t really matter. The important thing to Yu IlHan was a person to look after him and a person who would listen to him. And Lita took that place so he followed Lita. That was enough.

Yu IlHan was also the only human that Lita came into contact with for several tens of years, so she became to harbor feelings of more than just pity and compassion for the human known as Yu IlHan. Of course, she didn’t say that out loud.

The two’s strange relationship which occurred due to God’s error, was progressing in a truly marvelous direction.

“I’ll read some books.”
[That’s a good idea.]

Martial arts would become important after the Great Cataclysm occurs, but reading helps widening one’s reasoning and building the foundation for one’s actions. It would help, not harm.

Yu IlHan, who acted too fast that it may seem excessive after setting his mind on something, he shut himself inside the college library straight away. As he promised with Lita, he trained Vale Tudo and spearmanship for 3 hours a day, but he invested the rest of the time solely on reading.

Even the most well preserved books would change colors after several tens of years passed, but ‘thanks’ to the ‘stopped time’, objects didn’t get affected by time. It was a good thing for Yu IlHan.

His preferences leaned towards contemporary novels, but he got fed up after reading those for about 5 years and he moved onto others. While thinking that his ordinary college life might continue after the Great Cataclysm occurs, he first studied books related to his major which was business management, and when he was also about to get fed up with it, he considered plural majors and read psychology or other humanities-related books.

Unlike martial arts where the progress becomes less noticeable after a certain point, reading piled up knowledge. Yu IlHan, who was now hooked to reading, spread his interests to other books inside the library. Common knowledge, history, geography, classics, physics, chemistry, art – he read every single books existing in the library.

After a few years passed, the books inside the libraries were insufficient. There was no one guarding bookstores anyway, so Yu IlHan started conquering the bookstores within his walking range in search for books that weren’t in the library.

However, even this had a limit. On his 67th year of being left behind (Of course, Yu Ilhan no longer counted time), he made a big decision.

“Let’s learn another language.”
[Then let’s just change locations. I can deliver your meals wherever it is.]
“Where is that food coming from?”
[Secret.]

While pondering whether to cross the seas or not, he moved locations to China, the closest country. While driving any car to drive until he was out of fuel, when he found a working petrol station, he would refuel, and if not, he would just change cars.
License? There was only Yu IlHan in this world so it was okay as long as the car he drove didn’t fall off a cliff or exploded in a crash.

Even while moving, he studied Chinese in his spare time. The language studies made him sick after studying even a little became doable due to reading books for tens of years.

And the China he arrived at somehow was too wide. And there were of course, a lot of text to be read.

“Maybe it’s a mistake to set China as the first stop.”

Yu IlHan screamed in joy at the fact that there were so much new knowledge. Humanity will definitely come back before I get to know all the knowledge of China – at that fact, he even felt sorry for that.

However, that was his mistake. Even after adventuring all of the wide lands of China, and studying every book in China, humanity still didn’t come back. Yu IlHan no longer asked Lita how much time passed and Lita also didn’t speak of it.
He calmly moved to another country. It was because he felt that he might go crazy if he didn’t get new stimulation, no matter what it was.

Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, India, Mongolia…… After learning every language on Asia, he read all the books, records and even internet logs of all those countries. As if he would die if he didn’t read something, he read and read again.
Once, he forgot the iron rule of training martial arts for 3 hours a day and was close to getting beaten up by Lita.

[Are you really alright?]
“It’s alright. Anyway.”

He raised his head. The last page of the last book of the 7.5 million books inside the Russian academy of sciences was revealing itself.
Even though it was 7.5 million books, there were many books that also existed in other libraries, and to Yu IlHan, who could now read any book in a short time regardless of thickness due to reading repeatedly for countless years, it wasn’t that hard of a task.

“As expected, I can’t understand technical books even after reading them.”

Yu IlHan saw through the limits of this brain. It seemed that he wasn’t a person who was fit for sciences. He only read because there was text, and just reading the book didn’t make him a professional in that area.

“Now let’s go to Europe.”
[You’re speaking in Russian right now, you know?]
“Hyvää!”
[Okay, we can go to Finland.]

When he toured Europe, middle east, and even Africa, his vocabulary became rich.
It was the 216th year after he was left behind.

“Now there’s just Oceania and America left!”

Yu IlHan cheered like a middle schooler who just checked that there was little summer homework left. At his unchanging tension even though he had lived for over 200 years, Lita made a bitter smile and asked back.

[You do know that you have to go by boat, right?]
“It’s alright. There are many boats without owners in this world!”
[That’s called stealing.]

The power of time was truly amazing. It had made a clueless college student into an all-powerful adventurer. Of course, there was no need to say twice since one human was given more time than a human lifespan, but Yu IlHan kept moving without rest as if he would die the moment he stopped.

Using all the knowledge of Geography, he set the sailing distance to the minimum, and he looked for a boat which could hold out for that distance. In the countless books he read until now, there were many specialized books related to ships, so there wasn’t any difficulty finding a sturdy and a fueled boat, and driving it.

“Lita, humanity didn’t die out by any chance, right?”
[I said there was a deviation in the time axis. I was a fool for thinking it’s just twice or three times. It seems that it’s at least 10 times.]
“How exciting.”

After he finished preparing for the voyage, Yu IlHan left the land he was on without hesitation. As long as Oceania and America waited for him, there was no time for leisure.

And tens of years passed again.

“I finiiiiiiiiiiiiished!”
[Such a nasty guy.]

While looking at Yu Ilhan who was shouting and rolling around on top of the table inside Boston Public Library, known for being one of the biggest in America, Lita muttered with a
fed up voice.
Yu IlHan finally had conquered all the available books revealed to humanity. Even though she had watched the whole process with her own eyes, it was an unbelievable achievement.

After he left the library, sat down on a bench on the street and looked at the sky blankly for a while, Yu IlHan muttered while tilting his head.

“What do I do now?”
[Martial Arts?]
“I’ve done that until now too.”

He didn’t only read books while touring around the world. He went to various ruins which remained in some parts of the world, he found traces of martial arts and he kept revising various shortcomings in Vale Tudo and spearmanship. Training was 3 hours at the minimum and sometimes it would go over 8 hours, and 12 hours.

His fighting arts and weapon arts, which transformed to the point that he couldn’t find the original style, was developed into a practical and high level technique to the point that Lita would have a hard time fighting him without mana.
This was something that was unachievable by someone who didn’t have talent even if that person was given countless years. Lita of course didn’t tell this to Yu Il Han. Since he would get ahead of himself when she did!

“Lita, other than martial arts or knowledge, is there something that might help after the Great Cataclysm occurs?”

The question that flew towards Lita, who was thinking about Yu IlHan’s talent, was this. When she heard this, Lita could feel goosebumps.

[You……]

His question proved one thing.

Yu IlHan, who experienced more things than a human could experience in one lifetime, still didn’t lose hope despite the time that had passed.

To him, his life wasn’t over. No, perhaps he might be thinking that it didn’t start until now. All the things he did until now maybe just in preparation for the life after the Great Cataclysm.

It was a long time even for Lita, who was an angel, but a human who wouldn’t live past 100 on average was treating the past years as prior preparation. Of course, he himself didn’t know exactly how much time had passed, but that didn’t make Lita any less surprised.

[You, how can you be like that?]

As she was dumbfounded, Lita spat out the question she held back until now.
If Yu IlHan tried to boast for a bit, he might have answered with a fancier answer, but he, who lived while looking for new knowledge and experienced without being in contact with another human for countless years, only had candidness and honesty left. It might be considered that he regressed back into a child.

“You said I need to do it, so I do it. I can’t practice mana so I need to do other things.”
[……]

With Yu IlHan, who sighed while replying, in front of her, Lita lost her words to speak. The countless emotions and impulses mixed with each other and blew up to the point of bursting and bleached her mind pitch white.
Soon, she didn’t know what expression to make and turned her head and spread her wings.

[I’m going!]
“Tell me what to do before leaving!”
[Think about it yourself from now!]

Lita disappeared from the place, and Yu IlHan was dumbfounded. After cool-headedly judging the situation, he muttered again while sighing.

“Let’s first go back home.”

This was a historic moment where an angel harbored more than just good intentions towards a human. And obviously, Yu IlHan didn’t notice that.

Yu IlHan didn’t know, but this was the 274th year after being left behind.
Humanity didn’t return yet.

INSERT INTO `chapter`(`book_id`,`name`,`data`,`number_of_read`,`upload_date`) VALUES(2,'chapter 3','Yu IlHan, who returned to his home in Seoul, Korea, revised the fantasy novels. What would change when monsters start appearing in society, what else is needed other than strength and knowledge to do well in the changed society – he wanted to learn these.

The things Yu IlHan did right now was no different from Korean youths getting specs and studying early in order to ‘go to a good university’ or to ‘get employed in a good company’. That was obvious as the only thing he learned before he was left out was that. So perhaps it was an acceptable thing to pile up specs for hundreds of years.

[No, I definitely can’t accept it……!]

Lita, who came sneaked back to Yu IlHan’s side while he was researching various things from all kinds of fantasy novels, looked at him and shook her head. No matter how study-stricken Korean students are, is it possible to study for several hundred years!?

Of course, Yu IlHan’s current actions were mostly to due to escapism to forget his own loneliness, but not submitting under such a situation and finding new things to do was a proof of his strong mentality. No, perhaps the long period of training may have changed him.

“Lita, since you’re here, tell me. I want to try corpse dismantling or smithing. What should I try first?”

Yu IlHan looked at Lita with a serious gaze. Lita thought it was absurd but she had no choice but to reply.

[To confront monsters, defensive equipment and weapons made with monsters as materials are the most efficient so I can say ‘both’, but I think it’s easier for you to learn the basics of dismantling rather than smithing. It’s also more prioritized on the scene.]
“Then dismantling it is.”
[Hey, rest for a bit!]

Animals were abundant in this world, and Yu IlHan had the confidence to hunt any animal if he had a good spear so he didn’t hesitate. He looked for a suitable weapons factory and acquired a few sears and went into action.

Dismantling wasn’t easy. Not only was it difficult to hunt the animal without injuring it much, flaying the skin without damaging it and cutting the meat by parts and processing all of it was considerably profound; and the process was different for cows, pigs, bears, tigers, lions, elephants, etc.
However, time solved everything. Yu IlHan hunted and dismantled most of the animals he could hunt in several decades and learnt the techniques. It was to the point that he could estimate and see through how he would dismantle an animal he had never seen before.

“Lita, if I hunted all the animals now, wouldn’t monsters not appear then?”
[God has sent humans to other worlds in order for humans and monsters to compete in the same conditions.]
“Excluding me, that is.”

Lita naturally ignored Yu IlHan’s words and continued speaking.

[But if you kill all the animals now, then it goes against the ‘balance’. The reason I’m also helping you now is to match the balance, so do you think I will let you hunt all the animals? Just obediently hunt the amount I allow you to.]
“Tch.”

The last task of dismantling was the sperm whale.

[Stop it, you idiot!]
“Call me Ishmael……”
[Don’t tell jokes that nobody can understand!]
“Don’t say stupid things. It’s not that there’s nobody to understand but there are no people at all!”

While training martial arts for hundreds of years, and conquering all the libraries in the world, Yu IlHan became strangely stubborn. He acted first after deciding something was necessary to complete a task. Hunting sperm whales was an example.
Of course, sperm whales were designated as endangered species and was prohibited to hunt, but honestly, Yu IlHan couldn’t care less.

“Won’t the animal population have increased rapidly after humanity comes back?”
[Unlike you, they can’t eat and they don’t grow either, but like you don’t age, they don’t age and can’t reproduce. And that’s all……]
“And you’ll say ‘because time stopped’!”
[Because time sto……Whoa!?]

He spent one month before encountering a sperm whale, but that amount of time wasn’t even considered ‘waiting’. Yu IlHan who was calmly training his martial arts on the deck, finished hunting the sperm whale as soon as he encountered it and he dismantled it.

According to what Lita said, there were some monsters which carried parts that had a special effect or some other reason to be exchanged for a large sum, so dismantling a sperm whale which had ambergris was an extremely advisable practice.

[People usually think of escaping first when monsters appear in the world.]
“Who was it that made them prepare to fight and now you’re speaking nonsense? Anyway, now I’ve gotten used to dismantling, I will learn smithing.”
[Yeah, you do everything, eeeeverything.]

This was exactly on the 300th year after being left behind.

It was a hammer that he picked up without thinking, but he unexpectedly spent a lot of time on it. As he had to learn from existing records since there was no one to teach him, it was too difficult.
Still, as he had a body that was developed to an extreme due to hundreds of years of training, he was saved on the point that he didn’t feel tired even with all the perilous work.

“When! I! Read! Fantasy! Novels! They! All! Learn! Skills! Easily! But! Why! Can! I! Not! Do! Do! It! Like! Them!?”

Yu IlHan spat out each word each time he hammered the piece of metal on the anvil and ground his teeth. ‘Then don’t do it’ – these words came up to Lita’s throat but as she knew that Yu IlHan wouldn’t stop even if she said so, she just called wind and cooled the sweat on his head.

“Just! Teach! Me! The! Skill! To! Call! Wind!”
[I said you need to handle mana?]
“ARRGH!”

It took no less than 5 years for him to become used to using the furnace, extracting various metals such as iron, blowing the bellows, and produce a sword that could be considered ‘having an edge’.
Lita, who received Yu IlHan’s first work, which was neither a longsword nor a short sword but somewhere in the middle, gently closed her eyes and looked at the sword before voicing her honest opinions.

[I wonder if you can slice a radish with this.]
“I won’t tell you to slash a radish so give it back.”
[I want it was commemoration. I’ll ask Lord God to preserve this even after the world resets.]
“Why do you want to bully me so much……!?”

And when about 30 more years passed, Yu IlHan had the confidence that he made a sword that was better than factory-made ones.
And after 50 more years passed, he had confidence that the weapon he created surpassed all the existing weapons on Earth, but Yu IlHan, who knew well that his ability wasn’t good enough yet couldn’t stop there.

Like a student who received 97 points on a mock test, Yu IlHan clung to smithing which had no clear answer. He created weapons that contained metals such as swords, spears, and axes, and even polearms. He conquered defensive equipments such as battle gloves as well. And 50 more years passed like that.

“No, you can’t even cut a cucumber with this!”
[If the cucumber you know made of diamonds?]

It was truly unfortunate but all humans had something called ‘talent’. According to the presence or absence of this talent, there were people who wouldn’t be able to achieve something no matter how much effort they put into it; and there were people who would achieve a world record by just trying once; and there were people who achieved as much as they put into it.

Yu IlHan was in no way a genius that mastered a technique by just trying once. However, as he steadily put more effort, his ability was increasing. Slowly, but never stopping.
It was truly a coincidence, but to him who was forgotten by God and was left alone in the world, it was a blessing. The centuries became his asset without being wasted.

When 200 and a few more years passed since he first picked up the hammer, Yu IlHan succeeded in creating a weapon to his liking. He pursued weapons that he could create in his personal space so it wasn’t made from anything like titanium alloy or carbon fiber and such new materials, and was made from steel, but that spear was overly hard and sharp to be created by a human.

“How is it?”
[I thought there was a limit to the technology on Earth… but human tenacity brings miracles…….]
“Ahahaha. I’ve finally created a steel sword that can make Mo Palmo cry!……!”1
[This is a spear though.]

There were points that even Lita, an angel, would marvel at. The sharpness which seemed like one would get cut from just looking at it, and hardness. The spearpoint and the spear shaft was separated by a socket but the spear shaft was also made entirely from steel, and it was heavy.
Wielding this spear freely was only possible by Lita or Yu IlHan. Of course, there were only the two of them on Earth right now other than animals.

[But I kept telling you, though? When mana is released, new materials would be birthed endlessly, so why are you so obsessed with steel?]
“Now that I’ve gotten used to handling metals, I’ll be handle whatever material that comes at me.”

Yu IlHan indifferently replied and swung the spear after Lita handed it to him. As it was created to fit his body figure, the feeling he got when he swung it was addictively great. A handicraft that can be used for several decades or more if maintained it well, had been created.
This was on the 507th year after he was left behind.

“Then.”

Yu IlHan sighed while putting down the spear.

“What now?”

Lita’s heart sank after she heard those words. She wished for the time humanity would come back when she saw him holding the hammer for more than several decades, but she didn’t know that even now, when more than 50 times the estimated 10 years had passed, humanity didn’t return.

Just how much deviation is there on the time axis to become like this? Lita wanted to nitpick with God, but in truth, she hadn’t even met God in person. An existence that forever had to wait without requesting answers. She learned that from a senior angel.

[The Great Cataclysm must be coming soon, right? You don’t know when you have to fight with monsters so I think it’s better to train your martial arts and heighten your senses.]
“Well, I think we’re past the 100 year boundary so it’s about time for them to come back, right?”

Yu IlHan, who lived by immersing himself in the task in front of him, didn’t know the flow of time well. All time observation devices in the world had stopped so Lita, who was a higher existence, was the only one who could tell him the time. To Lita, it was instead fortunate.

And so, Yu IlHan started training his martial arts again. It was still Vale Tudo and spearmanship, but too many things had changed when compared to the beginning.
The degree of body tempering and techniques were different, and especially, his concentration was different. The concentration which increased due to reading and smithing was an incomparable achievement.

“Whoa, I feel like I’ve swung the spear for 3 hours. Lita, give me some food. I’m so hungry that I’m about to die.”

Perhaps due to concentrating while swing his weapon, he got more hungry. Yu IlHan thought that but Lita inwardly sweated cold sweat even though she was smiling outwardly. The time he concentrated on his spearmanship wasn’t 3 hours but 3 days.

From then, Lita prepared one meal per day – meaning one every 24 hours. Of course the amount was huge, but Yu IlHan instantly cleared it and concentrated on training again.

And when 200 years passed like that, Yu IlHan felt it was insufficient with just the spear so he started picking up other weapons. Daggers, greatswords, axes, and even guns couldn’t avoid his hand.
Martial arts was the same. He researched into and learnt Taekwondo, Aikido, Karate, Muay Thai, Kickboxing, and even some martial arts which only existed in records.

With that moment as the turning point, his physical body overcame the limit and started transforming. Above all, the power and durability of his muscles became stronger but the volume was decreasing little by little.
It wasn’t just something like ‘compressed muscles’ that people talked about. His body cells which were exposed to a miraculous state where it didn’t age but kept being active, was mutating due to the long period of training. Stronger, but efficiently in order to not become a hindrance to movement.

Of course, the bones, the skin, and even the inner organs were the same. As if it knew that it would have to confront many enemies in the future, it was strongly evolving to optimize itself to battle. Roughly speaking, it was comparable to a mutation that wouldn’t happen for several generations was happening in one human’s body.

Lita observed that and she couldn’t hide her disappointment. Thanks to God’s mistake, she was able to see a human exceeding humans even without mana, and when the Great Cataclysm happens and Yu IlHan learns mana, then he might grow up into a truly amazing existence!

‘Did you perhaps intend IlHan’s growth? Are you bullying him since IlHan’s growth isn’t to your liking yet? Just when…… Just when is it? He would approach his limit some time. Please send humanity back to earth before that happens. Before he decides to give up life, please……!’

As if mocking Lita’s prayer, which contained her earnest feelings, time kept flowing. Fortunately, Yu ILHan was immersed in martial arts so he wasn’t well aware of the flow of time, but unless he was God, he would eventually hit a limit.

When the limit approaches, what could Lita do for Yu IlHan? Just what?

‘If there is something that IlHan didn’t experience yet……’

Lita’s imagination which extended endlessly arrived at one point. A scene where a man and a woman were passionately entwining themselves on top of bed was playing in a strangely vivid manner inside her head. Among them, the woman’s face belonged to Lita. Then the man’s was……

After looking at Yu IlHan kicking and punching lumps of steel as fighting partner, her cheeks reddened like a tomato.

‘I’m so superficial even though I’m an angel who proceeds God’s orders. Even though it was a long time ago when I was freed from trivial emotions and desires…’

However, the more she thought about Yu IlHan’s figure immersing himself in reading, martial arts and smithing, her thoughts became more realistic.
The most novel and shocking stimulation. No matter how fed up Yu IlHan was with everything, wouldn’t he have no choice but to be fascinated by such a stimulation? Like the time he immersed himself in reading or smithing. To the point that he would immerse himself for 200 years without doing anything else……

Lita’s face became even more redder when she imagined that. To think her face would change due to emotions! If she told this to herself before coming to Earth, she would never believe it.

‘Yes, this is, in the end, to proceed with God’s orders and not to fulfill my desires. If there is a person who can’t wait for the Great Cataclysm and die mid way, that’s ruining God’s reputation. From the beginning, this was my reason for coming to IlHan so I’m absolutely in the right.’

With a speed that would make Usain Bolt cry, the thoughts inside her mind was justified. From the next moment, she was pondering on the timing to pounce at Yu IlHan.

She wanted to provide a new stimulation straight away according to her heart… No, for Yu IlHan, but while he’s immersing himself in martial arts, she couldn’t bother him. To tie his will here, she had to wait persistently.

At this point, Lita was having a huge misunderstanding. Yu IlHan was, of course, moving to escape from the dull life, but his principles in acting was was based in surviving after the Great Cataclysm occurs.

If he just wanted new stimulations, there were many things he could do. Whether it was games or sports, or whatever.
As she hadn’t considered this point, Lita was basically confessing that she loved Yu IlHan. Perhaps Lita also might have become strange while observing Yu IlHan for so many years.

However, sadly, or fortunately, the time for Lita to erupt her feelings and desires to Yu IlHan didn’t come.

When exactly 1 thousand years had passed after Yu IlHan was left by humanity.
The world resetted and humanity came back.

INSERT INTO `chapter`(`book_id`,`name`,`data`,`number_of_read`,`upload_date`) VALUES(2,'chapter 4','The first one to realize that something was wrong was not Lita but Yu IlHan.

“Something’s moving.”
[What’s moving?]
“Your sword.”
[What? Kyaaaa! No!]

The sword was trash amongst trash to the current Yu IlHan’s eyes – that sword which he made on his 5th year after picking up the hammer was vigorously vibrating on Lita’s waist.

Was it only that? The cars on the street, the clothes Yu IlHan was wearing, and others which made up the world was showing movement.
This meant one thing. The world was returning to the time when time first stopped.

“They are all the ones that were moved or changed since time stopped on Earth!”
[Rather than that, do something about this sword.]
“I’ll make you something better so why don’t you give up on it?”
[Never!]

While Lita was flustered and praying while grabbing on to the shabby sword, Yu IlHan’s body finally also moved against his will.

It wasn’t that his physical body was returning to its former state. It was just that he was moving to the place he was at when he was left out by humanity. With a visual that looked like a flying bird.

“I can fly!”1
[Ah, IlHan, wait! L, Lord God, just a bit! Just give me time to say farewell!]

Lita who realized the situation after she was focused on the sword, desperately shouted but God didn’t fulfill her request.
While Yu IlHan’s physical body was flying to the college campus from his home due to the irresistible, huge force, Lita was dragged to the sky due to another type of power. It was strong to the point that she cried from being sad.

[You took it easy until now but why so suddenly…… You’re going too far, You’re going too far!]

Lita insulted God while complaining, truly unbefitting a God’s envoy. The only thing she could do right now was to watch the distant Yu IlHan’s back and pray for his fortune. While tightly embracing the shabby sword.

‘You left the sword. So I take back the words ‘you’re going too far’.’

Will there be a time she meets Yu IlHan again? She prayed that they did. She prayed that she will see Yu IlHan after he is free from the clutches of time.
As soon as possible. Even tomorrow.

While embracing the hope that she wouldn’t even think about one thousand years ago, when she came to find Yu IlHan, a dropout, Lita slowly closed her eyes. And she realized one thing.

[In the end, we didn’t even kiss!]

At the same moment that poor angel Lita was returning, Yu IlHan also dropped in to the campus. Yu IlHan, who was half thrown at the last moment, balanced himself in mid-air and landed in a neat pose to reduce the damage done to him.

“I have a good feeling”

Above anything that he experienced in the long years, flying just now was definitely the most interesting. Wasn’t that a clear proof that the boring days had ended? While resolving that he would learn to fly by himself after learning mana, he raised his head.

And found Lita who was ascending into the skies.

“Ah.”

Yu IlHan subconsciously moaned. To think she left like that without any farewell, as expected, was Yu IlHan no more than just an interesting human to Lita? Was he an existence she hanged out with only to serve to fill her boredom?
But that didn’t matter. No matter what, Lita who confronted him was an existence who was kind, pretty and someone who consoled his loneliness. When he thought that he wouldn’t see her again in the future, he felt that his heart was empty.

Originally, this was normal. He thought that being with her was natural as he was together with her for a long time, but an angel such as Lita coming into contact with an ordinary person like Yu IlHan was, in the first place, an extremely rare case.

An existence that can never be connected to even in the same space. Didn’t Lita herself name herself a higher existence?

“A higher existence, eh……”
Yu IlHan softly muttered to himself and tightened his fists.

Pile up techniques and knowledge to not lose behind other humans when the Great Cataclysm occurs. This was Yu IlHan’s objective until now.
However, now, he had a grand, but a firm objective.

Higher existence, if I become one, then I’ll be able to meet and talk to her again. I will finally be able to stand on the same level as her.
So I’ll become one. There was nothing that didn’t work out after I put in effort so won’t I be able to become one if I work hard as if I’m about to die? – Yu IlHan resolved himself as such.

Of course, Yu IlHan didn’t know that forget same level, she had completely caught her heart to the point that he couldn’t catch any more. It was because he was a virgin who didn’t even hold hands with a woman for more than 1000 years.

Regardless of whether Yu IlHan resolved or not, the world was returning to its original state. The exploded cars were restored and returned to their original positions, and everything in the world, which was damaged when coming into contact with Yu IlHan, returned to its former state.

And that moment was approaching.
Yu IlHan calmly closed his eyes and waited, like he did in the distant past.

And when a few hours passed, he felt the world, and himself changing. He knew about his physical body more than anyone else. And a small but a clear change had occurred to his body.

A cool, luminous, wondrous, strong energy. When his heart beat, that energy also beat along with the heart as if it was originally like that.

He didn’t even need to ponder about it. This was mana. A new energy that Earth had come in contact with. The energy that humans adapted to in the 10 years they stayed in other worlds. The energy that Yu IlHan had to adapt to in the future.

‘Well, I’ll probably be able to do it.’

He was different to his past self who was a childish college freshman. No, well, the two were on the same point in the time axis, but doesn’t he have a history of the countless years of effort, and its achievements?

He opened his eyes. There were a lot of people inside the campus which was cramped. While making expressions that they were surprised, but nervous as if they were waiting for this.

People. There were really a lot of people. Due to being too happy, he wanted to scream, but he suppressed it.

“We really came back after 10 years.”
“According to their words, we can finally……”
“Uu, I’m scared.”
“Hey, I can open the status here too!”
“Dang, everything really reset!”

Screams and exclamations could be heard here and there. It was at this moment that Yu IlHan felt that something was off.

The fact that they said that they came back in 10 years was something that Lita said and it was nothing strange. However, aren’t they too familiar with each other? Normally, when people lived separately in other worlds, it was normal to be awkward with each other.

If not, then what. Doesn’t that mean that everyone here was in the same world!? No, wait, thinking about it, there was no reason to separate the people who were in the same place. And if that’s true…… Wouldn’t they find out that Yu IlHan was left behind!?

Yu IlHan became nervous and he turned his head even though the ‘people’ he had missed for such a long time were in front of him. However, it was impossible. He was in the center of the square. He could only be found o……

‘……Eh?’

Yu IlHan raised his head. However, the people around him only talked to themselves and didn’t spare a glance towards Yu IlHan. No, it seemed like they hadn’t even noticed him.

Of course, the special situation of just being returned played a role, but they had a good reason to find out about him but as if they had planned beforehand, they were all ignoring him. How was this possible!?

‘Oh. It was like that wasn’t it?”

However, after pondering for a bit, Yu IlHan had no choice but to accept the impossible situation.
He had forgotten due to talking with Lita for so many years, but he had a legendary achievement of being left out during elementary school picnic, middle school training camp, and high school trip.

Was it only that? Being missed out even if he raised his hand at the very front seat while registration in college happened very often. It was no exaggeration to call him the Phantom Sixth Man.

And so, there was no way the excited Earthlings could recognize Yu IlHan. Once a loner was forever a loner.

“Great, I say. Great, you Earthlings……!”

He even spoke out loud but the people surrounding him didn’t look like they had noticed him at all. For some reason, the returnees he had waited for such a long time had appeared but he cried tears of not from being touched but tears of sadness.
He really wanted to see Lita who always recognized him. He wanted to become a higher existence as soon as possible. However, before that, he first.

‘Let’s go back faster than anyone and different to everyone.’

With drooped shoulders, he left the campus while ignoring the returnees’ cheers, their unease for the future, and their expectations for change. It was none of his business. I hope everyone falls down and have their noses broken – he thought.

The bus still didn’t run. Well, it was no time for both the bus drivers and the passengers to sit down on the bus. They would probably go home and wait for the official announcement by the government or hurrying to meet their beloved ones after the unavoidable separation.

In any case, It was Yu IlHan, who could run at tens of kilometers per hour if he ran a little fast, so he didn’t have the intention to take the bus in the first place. It was no lie that he was faster than anyone. Of course, that was if mana wasn’t taken into account.

‘She said that mana was an almighty power. It can strengthen the physical body, make it move faster, or generate strong power.’

If he remembered the scenes where Lita used magic, he could accept it. Human class would once again be divided into those who can and those who can’t. Unlike humanity who had practiced for 10 years, Yu IllHan awakened to mana just now, so it they were categorized into mana ability, then he would be placed at the bottom.

‘What’s so wrong about that? The knowledge and training I piled up is in no way inferior. If 10 years pass, I can grow without having to be envious of anyone.’

Now that he trained for countless years, he now had such a confidence. Truthfully, even that was under evaluating his personal ability, but he himself didn’t know that. It was because Lita forbid him to say those in order for him to not get ahead of himself.

‘Oh, yeah. Status.’

It was his thought just before he arrived at home. Lita said that due to the Great Cataclysm, the Akashic Records had come into contact with Earth and humans gained the right to see some of its records. The other returnees also talked about status and whatnot.

But how can I see this?
As soon as he thought that, green texts started popping up in his eyes as if it was being engraved on his retina.

[Yu IlHan]
[Human jobless Lv1]
[Title – Pancosmic Loner (Concealment becomes passive)]
[Strength – 72 Agility – 81 Health – 78 Magic – 1]
[Active Skills – Concealment Lv Max (Evolvable. Skill evolution materials are necessary.)]
[Passive Skills – Unidentifiable]

[Dropout bonus was acquired, and distributed]
[Status rises by 5 when levelling up by 1.]

“……”

The thousand years of training was showing its results.

INSERT INTO `chapter`(`book_id`,`name`,`data`,`number_of_read`,`upload_date`) VALUES(2,'chapter 5','Yu IlHan became silent. He was in a state of being greatly surprised.

From the moment Lita mentioned the word ‘status’, he was able to predict that human power would be measured using levels. And so, a game stat window that anyone would recognize had appeared and that wasn’t a problem.

The monstrous status also wasn’t a problem. The results of his training was visualized so he could only be happy.
The distributed status bonuses weren’t a problem either. It wasn’t a game where you could raise the stats you want and he also expected that he wouldn’t be able to raise magic that way.

Yes. Those weren’t the problems.

The problem is the title and the skill. Concealment which he does not remember learning and that title which was full of intentions to make fun of Yu IlHan!

What is this, concealment becomes passive? You mean I’m concealed!? Is my life concealed!? I’m a loner even if I go into space!?

A violent rage he never experienced in his life surged. This was the moment where he got another objective other than becoming a higher existence to meet Lita. An objective to beat that Akashic Records up!

If there was one thing that he had questions about, that was the passive skills. Thinking about the definition of Akashic Records on Earth, it was unbelievable that it couldn’t record one person’s ability perfectly.
It wasn’t some human who could make mistakes and it was a universal record! To make it error, one had to be outside of the realm of recognition and record – like a God.

How could this be unidentifiable? Yu IlHan, who thought about this until he reached his house, successfully thought up of one hypothesis.

‘Currently, my physical ability and concealment techniques are revealed so it can record it. However, it might be that it doesn’t have any records of the abilities I learnt in the past. All my training happened on Earth when time was stopped. Moreover, that was before the Akashic records came into contact with Earth.’

Under the assumption that Yu IlHan’s hypothesis was right, It was very possible that all of Yu IlHan’s doings on Earth, when time was stopped by the power of God, aren’t recorded in the Akashic records. Yu IlHan wasn’t sure but in reality, it was like that.

‘Well, I’ll know if I move.’

Yu IlHan trusted more in the days he had lived and trained than the sudden few lines appearing in his eyes. It wasn’t like he couldn’t swing his spear just because the skills status is unidentifiable so it had none to do with him.

He opened the front door to his house and went inside. He was planning to have a simple shower before moving around to check what passive skills pop up.

But in the next moment, one person came in his field of vision.

“Ah.”

Really, only that stupid sound came out of his mouth. The moment to realize how foolish he was came next.
How could he have forgotten the most important thing? How couldn’t he remember his most beloved family?

“IlHan.”

His mother was in front of his eyes.

Although they were far apart for such a long period of time to the point that he felt unfamiliar even when he looked at the picture, he realized just after seeing her like this. The fact that the middle aged woman crying in front of him was his mother.

That wasn’t remembered by his brain, but his heart.

“Mom.”

While saying out loud the word he hadn’t spoken for a long time, Yu IlHam embraced his mother.
He cried like a little child that made the past countless years seem like nothing. His mother cried along with him. They cried just like that until his father arrived.

After crying their hearts out, they became hungry. His mother, Kim YeSeul, also seemed to be the same as she started cooking.

Yu IlHan had received his meals from Lita for as long as 1000 years (Though, he himself didn’t know), but he hadn’t the scene of her cooking, so he was touched when he saw his mother standing in the kitchen.
The savory smell as rice became done, the rhythmical kitchen knife sounds and the sound from the heaten up frying pan were all delightful to him.

“Thank you for the meal!”

The dinner using all the ingredients in the house, was very peaceful. There were some that looked like she had learnt from the another world.
However, Yu IlHan couldn’t enjoy the meal peacefully. It was because his parents started talking about the other wolrds.

“Where were you sent to, my son? Mother went to a world called Ya-umin along with the people in our neighborhood.”
“A nameless one.”

He couldn’t make them worry by saying that he was left on Earth all alone. Fortunately, his muscles decreased in volume while mutating so on the outside, there was not much difference before being left out. There was no worry that he would be found out just based on his outer appearance.

“Heishia was a truly perfect world if you ignore the fact that there’s no rice. And also, that handling mana or whatever was truly hard. Even if I do get used to it, there’s no way your father would be able to confront monsters.”

Yu IlHan’s father, Yu YongHan1 complained while having the first big spoon of rice he had in 10 years. Kim YeSeul also agreed.

“That’s what I mean. They brought the newborn babies, elderly, and even pregnant women and made them suffer. It was too pitiful to see them suffering for those 10 years. It would’ve been better if they just took the young and sturdy ones.”
“They said it’s because it would go against the balance. Meaning that even though they knew the most efficient way, they couldn’t take it.”
“Sorry?”

Towards Yu IlHan, who blurted the truth he heard from Lita by accident, the gazes of his parents were directed. Yu IlHan realized then.

There weren’t many occasions to lie in his life until now, but to him who had lived a different life from others, there would be a lot he had to hide from now on. The moment he had to fix the habit of saying what he thought in his mind had come.

“N, no. I’m just thinking if that is the case.”
“Balance? Efficiency? To hell with that. When I think about how they brought people away from home for 10 years and put them through suffering, I grind my teeth, my teeth.”
“So you ground your teeth to your heart’s content so you won’t anymore, right? Every time I hear you grinding your teeth, I grind my teeth because I’m annoyed.”

While wishing that the day he had to present them with implants in their gums won’t come, Yu IlHan finished eating his meal. But when he realized, his parents’ gazes focused on him.

“How about you, son? You can kill monsters if you handle mana well, right? When I talked with the ladies around, they said that the people who can kill monsters well will earn money!”
“They sure will. There weren’t many that had talent in that, were there? Monsters or whatever bullshit they are, they are dangerous, so if one says they want to kill it, won’t the country take care of them?”
“What are you saying, what money would the country give us!? It’s not that. Their corpses are worth so much money!”

Looking at his parents talk about fantasy stuff that only happened in novels so naturally, it was quite strange for Yu IlHan. His feeling of being left out was really serious and he thought about the dropout life.
Even though humanity returned, I’m still a loner…… He was angry at the fact that it was no different from his life until now and he didn’t feel that sad.

But I should be more aware of deep-sea fish than my parents! – when he thought that, he became even more empty so he stopped there.

“I can’t use mana.”

And he confessed the truth.

“Yes. Let’s study well, son.”
“I knew it. You can’t win against genes, eh?”

His parents accepted it too easily so he instead became dejected. However, that was not unreasonable. To his parents, he was a son who was stuck at home playing games or reading or studying all day, and hated exercise.
To them, it would be hard to imagine that their son would suddenly wield mana around his body and rush out while saying that he would hunt monsters. They probably asked with ‘what if’ only to get their answer of ‘as expected’.

“Just listen to the government’s announcement. Apparently, it will come out on the 9 o’clock news.”
“They are so untrustable. What if a monster appears in our neighborhood? Should we move to a place where a strong ability user is?”
“It’ll be alright. But you shouldn’t go to work for a while.”
“How could I? The company already called me more than ten times. I have to go even if I have to die on the way.”
“Hey! Don’t say unlucky things like that!”

His parents were happily chatting together. As it had been a long time, their longing for each other seemed to have piled up and they seemed closer. Honestly, he was prepared for a reverse effect, so Yu IlHan could only be thankful.

He gave up watching TV in the living room, and he returned to his own room while thinking that he might have a little sibling this time next year. He planned to search materials on the internet about the current situation.

However, he stiffened his body with the same amount of shock as when he first met his mother.

“……Why is this here?”

Was this God’s prank? Or was this because Lita’s wish flooded in a strange direction?

Wrapped in dry cloth, his masterpiece steel spear was in the middle of his room.

The moment he noticed that, Yu IlHan locked the door to his room. His mother would be surprised if she knew that there was a weapon inside her son’s room, wouldn’t she?

“Why did this remain?”

Every change that occurred due to his influence should have been reverted back when the world was returning to the point when he was first left out. Even his spear made with the efforts of his body and soul shouldn’t have been an exception.

But why? There was no way of finding out. Did God give him a bonus because he felt sorry for just a status bonus? Lita all over the place wanting the sword to remain, was there some over-effect from that?

In any case, it was a thankful thing. He was thinking to make a spear he would use in the near future, so he was thankful to God who relieved him of that effort.
Yu IlHan first picked it up intending to hide it in his closet. But at that moment, like the time he saw the status, green texts started appearing in his eyes.

[Yu IlHan’s steel spear]
[Rank – Unique]
[Attack Power – 800]
[Durability – 500/500]
[A miracle made by human hands using pure technique to mold the spear without mana. It has hardness and strength comparable to that of a mid-class monster’s bones.]

“How should I know if attack power of 800 is high or not?”

But looking at the description from the Akashic Records, he thought that it would help until he acquired new materials so he put it in his closet. He wished for there to be inventories since there was status and mana and all, so he was disappointed.

“Then shall I start?”

The return of humanity, and the Great Cataclysm that happened at the same time as it was waiting for it. People were spread out to countless other worlds, but now that they have returned, they had to cooperate to adapt to the changed reality. Countless people should be pouring out information on what they know through countless routes.

Among those, the route that Yu IlHan selected was the internet. it was because it was the most approachable, the widest, and the one he was most familiar with.

‘There’s new text.’

Yu IlHan sat down in front of his laptop with shining eyes. The internet pages which weren’t renewed for such a long time was now changed to something completely new. Yu IlHan smiled when he saw that. He now felt delight when there was the slightest of a new stimulation. Did Columbus feel like this when he found the new continent?
He became the captain of the boat which sailed the new seas and sailed to the seas known as information.

When 4 hours passed, Yu IlHan closed the laptop. It was because he was assured that he had enough information now.

As everyone talked differently, he had a hard time picking out the truth, but Yu IlHan’s analytical ability and concentration was at the peak due to the several centuries of reading.
When he used the official announcement from the government as basis, and organized the information inside the articles that other people wrote, it was over easily. In other words, there was not much information that he could fish out.

‘There are too many liars.’

I hunted a dragon in another world, I subdued a princess knight made her as a sex slave, I solved the bonus question engraved on the back of throne of a huge empire so I acquired permanent item – b*llshit like these were everywhere.
The description about levels and monsters were also all over the place, so listening to them, he might as well believe that a kobold killed a demon race.

‘Then shall I pick out the most objective milestones?’

He first organized the information on levels.

Until level 5 was an ordinary civilian. The majority of the standards to pick soldiers in other worlds were 7, and when one became level 10, one can have swordsman, archer, and other classes as their jobs and could think of becoming a captain of 10 men.

When one became level 50, then the class advances. It was a sort of 2nd advancement. As it seemed like powerful people and non-powerful people were separated using that line, advancement wasn’t done by anyone and pass a strict condition to understand the Akashic Records better.
If one didn’t advance to the 2nd job, then one cannot go over level 50, and if someone did go through their 2nd advancement, then even nobles wouldn’t look down on them.

3rd advancement was possible at level 100. From that moment, one would be treated as a high class fighting power of the country. Levelling up by one became hellish and there are not many who would grow anymore.

It was known that there was a 4th advancement, but at least on the internet, there weren’t any that saw a person with a 4th job. There were only predictions about high class monsters, such as dragons, on their 4th, 5th or even higher classes. This was the information about the levels.

Among the rest, there weren’t many that were important.

First, tomorrow, he had to go to college as normal. It was because the government, joint with the army, said that they will come up with countermeasures against monsters and emphasized everyday life.
There were also announcements about making a special corps made up of mana users after creating anti-monster headquarters, but who knows. It wasn’t such a credible announcement.

‘I should protect my own body.’

The training and suffering was for that. He had no thoughts of going to college normally and be dragged around passively with the situation.
So let’s train in mana.

“Phew.”

As he thought that there weren’t many differences even after humanity had returned, he sighed. At the same time, he remembered about the kind and beautiful Lita who was always next to him when he was training and he longed to see her.

“I want to see Lita.”
[If she knew that, she will be very delighted.]

At the voice he heard from somewhere, he stiffened before abruptly turning back.

On the wide open window sill, a small, winged something was standing there. If one ignored the fact that it was very small, its outer appearance was similar to Lita.

[I am sent here to help you adjust to mana, and I’m……]

“An intruder of private property?”
[Angel Erta.]

It was the moment he met the second intruder of private property…… Angel.
',0,'2019-05-01 23:00:01.000000');
INSERT INTO `chapter`(`book_id`,`name`,`data`,`number_of_read`,`upload_date`) VALUES(2,'chapter 6','The small angel who came into the room, Erta ignored the pre-conversation and started talking whatever she wanted.

[For humans, the energy they acquired postnatally, mana, is extremely difficult to handle. The reason why humanity had to spend 10 years in other worlds is also because one has to experience that much number of years to acquire the possibility of using mana.]
“Humanity excluding me.”

At Yu IlHan’s retort, Erta showed a clear annoyance on her small face and continued speaking.

[Angel Lita used that point to strongly claim the assistance on the human Yu IlHan. While saying that it was seriously unfair to leave the dropout, who only trained his body a little, like this, she requested the dispatch of an angel to help him adapt to mana in a short period of time.]

When he heard that Lita stepped out for him, Yu IlHan felt his heart pound. Although they separated without being able to say their farewells, she also seemed to worry about Yu IlHan.

[Because of her strong claims, her request was approved. Lita wanted to take on the role herself, but due to the decision of the higher-ups who were worried about a human becoming too close to an angel, I was dispatched in her place.]
“Is that so.”

It would be a lie if he said he wasn’t disappointed, but he also thought that it was instead fortunate. He resolved to become a higher existence in order to meet Lita, but if they met for some random reason before that, wouldn’t he be fired up for nothing?

However, Erta had the expression of not liking the situation.

[But now that I’m here, the situation is a bit different to what she said.]
“What is?”

[How is this ‘a little’……]

While scanning Yu IlHan’s physical body which ascended into a new realm without the help of mana, she muttered with a small voice that couldn’t be heard by Yu IlHan.

Even considering 1000 years, the evolution of his body was at the level of being unbelievable. If strong power of mana was added to this body, how far could this human grow? It was to the point that she was curious about it.

If they knew that he had trained his body until this point beforehand, then the dispatch of Erta wouldn’t have happened. However, Lita asserted this work with a force that was never seen before with her, the moment she returned to Heaven, and her request which looked very reasonable on the surface was passed, prepared, and realized at the speed of grilling beans with lightning. And the situation Erta met was this.

However, an already realized thing wouldn’t be reverted. Erta, who descended with a mission, couldn’t return until she completed that mission.
In other words, they were all perfectly done in by Lita. To think she would use such a sly method even though she was an angel, who is supposed to be the most pure existence in the world!

Erta sighed again and spoke with a powerless voice.

[In any case, I’m planning to help you until you can use mana skillfully. So please learn it fast.]
“How will you help me?”
[It’s simple. A higher existence, me, just being near you activates the mana inside you. Recognition, control, use – in these regards, you would be able to adapt 10 or more times faster than ordinary people.]

In the past, when he didn’t have a single inkling of mana in his body, it was impossible even with Lita sticking to him for 1000 years, but now that the Great Cataclysm had occurred, 1 year was sufficient – this was Erta’s calculation.
Yu IlHan also didn’t know anything about mana so he could only nod his head at her words. He would just accept whatever she spoke of.

When the conversation ended, Erta flew and placed herself on his head. What are you doing? – he said while brushing his head, but Erta didn’t budge a abit.

[I have magic cast on me to prevent recognition from other lower existences so you don’t need to mind.]
“……So you will continue to stay on top of my head in the future?”
[That is so.]

That was no good. Mostly, the 1.7Terabytes of treasure in his hard drive (And one piled up during the countless years) is in a difficult position.1
Even Lita didn’t stick to him all day, but to think an ambush like this would come now!

[I don’t care whatever a lower existence like you do. So you don’t need to worry.]
“You read my mind?”

For that instant, Yu IlHan seriously pondered whether to return the angel or not, but he couldn’t miss the opportunity to adjust to mana in just 1 year.

Yes, it’s one year. He needed to endure for just one year. Yu IlHan cried blood and accepted reality.

[I really don’t care if you break dance, belly dance, or do dance dance revolution.]
“I care! And you know what the last one is, right?”

The next day after humanity returned, the Korean morning was mixed with the anxiety that the world would change and a slight expectation for the changing society, it looked very lively on the surface. The people Yu IlHan saw, after leaving his house with Erta on top of her head, was like that.

If one ignored the soldiers in army uniform with guns securing the perimeter while walking due to the joint operation with the government.

“F*ck, I was drinking with a woman at my side until yesterday morning……!”
“But it’s better than the climbers in the mountains, sir…… I heard monsters have already appeared.”
“If I kill monsters, I can at least level up! I need to find my Thunder Sword quickly!”
“Corporal Seo, The entire regiment knows that you didn’t earn a skill until the end in Guundia……?”

Yu IlHan shook away the breath of despair which would come his way in the near future and hurried to college2. He thought that he walked slowly, but as it took the amount of time it would take him by car and he arrived early, he felt funny even when he himself thought about it.

He went to the humanities campus of Sungkyunkwan university3

Befitting of being built within the city, Sungkyunkwan university was built on a hill that made its students seriously wonder whether it was commuting or climbing, thanks to using a small area of land as efficiently as possible.
Of course, that level was laughable for the current Yu IlHan.

The campus was filled with a lot of people. As most of them were young college students, they tended to think positively about what they became able to do rather than the crisis they were about to meet. And most of them were talking about a topic that Yu IlHan didn’t know about.

“Did you make a skill?”
“How about you? I managed to make one somehow.”
“Fuu. Two for me.”

Yu IlHan asked Erta with a small voice.

“……What does it mean to make a skill?”
[It means creating something to use in an attack somehow by combining tiny bits of mana and insignificant records. As a higher existence, in my view, even if you combine all the skills that they are boasting about, I think that it will pale in comparison to your concealment.]
“Concealment wasn’t a skill I wanted……!”

One could arbitrarily make skills? Anyway, this was something he didn’t learn yesterday. Yu IlHan perked up his ears and walked. New stimulation. New information. They were all things that he loved.

Anyway, the results.

“In the end, who was ‘Empress’?”
“Nobody knows. Does that make sense? It’s the sole Sung U’s person who flew her name for 10 years in Lanpas, and we don’t know.”
“But wouldn’t we know if monsters appear?”
“I don’t know. Maybe she would wear a mask again.”

He learnt that there was a woman called ‘Empress’ who showed mighty ability in the other world in his university, and.

“When would dungeons appear?”
“Even if it appears, you wouldn’t be able to go in, I think. There’s a level requirement. What level are you?”
“Level 7.”
“I’m level 4.”
“Huu.”
“Sh*t……”

He learnt that there were places called dungeons in other worlds and that one needed to have high levels in order to enter it. Other than that, there weren’t many information that he could make out, but there was a reward just in knowing about dungeons.

Dungeon. It was a word that made a person’s heart pound.

In the lecture room he arrived quickly, there were already many people. To think that they attended school even after they spent 10 years in other worlds… Did they perhaps also miss the ordinary lives like Yu IlHan did?”

While soaking himself in emotion, he looked around the lecture room, but there wasn’t a person he knew anyway. It was trivial but what is the reason that he became sad all the time? Yu IlHan, who found an empty seat and sat down, was afraid that he might be heard by other people so he wrote the questions he had until now that he didn’t ask Erta.

‘What is a dungeon exactly?’

And when he held it up slightly, Erta, who was on top of his head, recognized that and spoke.

[It’s a trap.]
“A trap?”

As he heard an answer that was too unexpected, Yu IlHan ended up speaking out loud. However, his concealment was truly amazing and that level of voice wasn’t found out by the people around him. So sad.

[It’s a trap installed by God. By installing attractive baits for monsters, it attracts them and close the exit. The gathered monsters become trapped inside the dungeon, and unlike monsters, humans, who can freely enter and exit once they have the qualifications, can hunt with more safety.]
‘That’s also a consideration from God to the humans, huh. …… But Isn’t it over if they’re trapped? You can just leave it alone, right?’
[A dungeon is naturally destroyed after a certain period of time, so the monsters inside it have to be dealt with before that. In the first place, there are many monsters who don’t get caught in the trap, and there are many which can destroy it, and many that can camouflage as dungeons so carelessness is forbidden.]

While Yu IlHan and Erta were conversing, the professor came and the lecture started. However, the professor didn’t seem to have an intention to teach a lecture and the students didn’t seem to want to listen properly either. Yu IlHan, who expected a lecture after such a long time, became slightly disappointed.

“Every one of you will have to adapt fast to the changing society. The situation is that UN is already proposing the banning of indiscreet use of mana, and a regulation on levelling up, and strong countries including America and China, are focusing their attention to the changing environments and monsters due to mana. According to how Korea would act, countless industries would collapse and countless other industries would rise.”

During the entire 50 minutes of the lecture, the professor was haughtily spouting out what anyone could think up about. Thanks to that, Yu IlHan forgot the centuries of loneliness in an instant and waited earnestly for the end of lecture. No, he questioned if he needed to keep going to university in the first place.

In his life in the future, how much importance would a certificate of university graduation have? He could only shake his head. He just came as he knew how much worry his parents would have since they knew he couldn’t use mana.

If he became able to use mana, then he will stop going to a school where he’s ignored by everyone! It wasn’t his fault! It was the society, and the university that’s bad!
Erta spoke as if she predicted what he was thinking at that moment.

[The efficiency in training mana doesn’t become different no matter what you do in whatever place. No, there’s one.]
‘What is it?’
[Hunting monsters.]
‘I don’t like dangerous things.’

He couldn’t even use mana but she wanted him to confront monsters? It was Yu IlHan, who rejected thinking it was nonsense, but Erta spoke as if she knew that such a reaction would come.

[Like the humans on Earth having low levels right now, the monsters which would appear later and the dungeons too, would have low levels. It is because they came into contact with mana just recently. There may be high level ones or colonies from natural disasters, but that is, in the end, a special case, and it’s possible to recognize and avoid beforehand.]
‘Hmm. That’s true but……’
[Now that the absolute majority of the monsters are weak, it would be advantageous in the long term to adapt to mana faster by acquiring experience.]

Yu IlHan hated dangerous things. The countless years of immersing in self-training was, in the end, for him to not die meaninglessly after the Great Cataclysm. However, perhaps as a side effect, as countless years have passed, when he knew that it wasn’t dangerous, he had the boldness to unhesitantly move his body once he was sure that there was no danger.

A typical example would be crossing the world to conquer libraries, and the one where he went out to sea on a fishing boat to reproduce the scene of Moby Dick.

At that time, he thought that it was necessary, but strictly speaking, it was close to the domain of amusement rather than the domain of training. He had acted subconsciously to not paralyze his mentality in the flow of the countless time.

‘……Good. I’ll have a go, then.’

This was the same. He judged that it wasn’t dangerous, and when he was assured that it would help his survival in the future, he expressed his will to ‘do it’ without a moment of hesitation. Erta spoke as she waited for this moment.

[You won’t be able to go inside dungeons as there is a level requirement. So you would have to hunt the monsters outside. Considering your level now, then wouldn’t you be able to kill monsters around level 25?]
‘……I’m still level 1, you know? I can’t even use mana, you know?’
[Instead, you have a monstrous physical body. I even said this considering that you don’t have a sturdy defensive equipment. If you did, then you will be able to hunt even higher level monsters.]

The problem was to find such monsters.

[Fuu. I’m a higher existence. To get away from you faster…… not that. To help your growth, I can help you finding monsters.]
“How?”
[If there is a monster nearby, then I can detect it.]
“……”

In the end, the route Yu IlHan chose was the internet again. Honestly, he didn’t expect much. He planned to leave with Erta as soon as the lecture ended.

However.

[F*ck. People inside the building, never set foot outside from now on.]
[Who the hell lied? Outside right now is hell.]
[The inside is also hell. Can’t you see the building collapsing?]
[It’s the first time I saw soldiers shooting guns since I was born. Sh*t. soldier bros are so cool.]
[Yeah. you’ll be able to shoot them soon ^^]
[Before training mana to level up, don’t we have to legalize arms first?]

The articles in a community website was slightly over exaggeratedly harsh. Yu IlHan clicked one of those articles, and not a long time later, one photo came up on the screen.

A hunting dog which grew to the size of a bull, was attacking a human with a fiercely twisted face.
It was too terrible to accept as reality, but the dog was too realistic for it to be a CG.

Yu IlHan raised his head. When did the lecture pause. Everyone, including the professor and the students stuck themselves on the window and looked down on the square.

He stood up slowly and approached them. While nobody paid attention to him. He looked down at the narrow grass square over the glass window.

They were there.
Insects the size of humans – monsters.
',0,'2019-05-01 23:00:01.000000');
INSERT INTO `chapter`(`book_id`,`name`,`data`,`number_of_read`,`upload_date`) VALUES(2,'chapter 7','While looking at that scene, Yu IlHan was unexpectedly calm. It was because he always thought that a day where this could happen would come.

Perhaps other people may also have some worry about this in some corner of their hearts. In fact, they may have more resolve than Yu IlHan. They experienced other worlds for the last 10 years. Wouldn’t everyone know well that the Earth is different from before the Great Cataclysm?

However, they had insufficient preparation. The fighting power to go against the monsters weren’t there no matter how they looked at it, and the levels of the monsters seemed quite high.
They either judged the situation wrong, or they don’t have the leisure to.

[Tutorials have already ended. Lord God has already given everything that he can to humanity. Humanity has to survive by itself from now on.]

Erta’s voice sounded quite distant. From that, Yu IlHan felt that she looked at the scene with different eyes. He was convinced that she wouldn’t help in anyway no matter how much energy she had.
Unless an unexpected element came up.

It seemed like there were no casualties yet. However, lest their eyes fall on the buildings, it was a matter of time before a casualty occurs. Actually, they were slowly coming towards the building, that is, the Business Hall that the students along with Yu IlHan was in.

“Kyaaaaak!”
“What should we do? We gotta run!”
“Everybody calm down. The school has already contacted the……”
“Who wants to party with me and hunt that!”
“Here! One more casualty please!”1
“Run, f*ck!”
“F, Finance Hall! Let’s run to the Finance Hall!”
“Isn’t the roof better!?”

The students who realized that danger was approaching, ran out the lecture room while screaming. The professor also sighed and followed them.
As a result, in an instant, Yu IlHan was left alone in the lecture room. If it came to this, it was suspicious whether he had a special skill to become a loner.

However, he also had no thoughts of sitting there quietly alone in the lecture room.

Yu IlHan looked over the window again, and sighed shortly.
And started moving.

[You’re planning to go, aren’t you?]
“They look much weaker than sperm whales. Isn’t this a good opportunity?”
[Monsters are different to animals. Skin…… Well, in their case, carapaces, become abnormally hard, and their motion capacity changes too. However, yes…… There doesn’t seem to be any that goes over 20 so it’s a good opportunity for levelling up.]
“Yeah. I won’t move if it’s dangerous.”

While muttering in self-mockery, Yu IlHan looked around before approaching a desk and pulling out its legs.
It was insufficient with just one so he pulled out all 4 of them and grabbed one in his hand while tieing up the rest after ripping a part of his shirt and tied it around his waist and tightened it. That happened in 10 seconds after he was left alone.

[……Your handicrafts are neat.]
“Yeah. I was bored so I played around with some things and I got better at it.”
[Lita……!]

The abs that were revealed due to ripping his clothes were truly perfect. His physical body, which was trained to its extreme limits to become the peak of the living, was revealed slightly.
However it was his own body, so Yu IlHan ran out of the lecture room without reacting to that. At first, he was about to go straight to the square but he soon remembered that he was bare faced.

“No matter how high my concealment level is, they will recognize me if I stir up the plaza, no?”
[A mask is sufficient. It will probably increase the effect of concealment.]

If it was a mask, he could think up of one.
The underground stationery store of the Business Hall.

When his thoughts reached there, he quickly ran towards the stairs and jumped over the railings. He grabbed onto the pillar to slide down to floor B3. He ran to the stationery store and randomly picked an Ir*nman mask and put it on his face.
This was another 10 seconds. It was an inhuman reaction time.

“Shall we go?”

He jumped over the stairs to go to the ground floor and came out to the square. Coincidentally, a human sized mantis was in the middle of destroying the spinning door of the Business Hall.

[Kuiiiiiiiii!]
“Paha!”

With a strange shout, Yu IlHan’s body flew across the air. The moment his razor-sharp kick landed on the mantis’s head, its head burst with an unpleasant ‘puk’ sound. It was a refreshing laughable insta-kill.

[You have earned 800 experience.]
[You have become level 3. 2 Health, 2 Magic, 3 Strength, 3 Agility increases.]
[You have awakened Physical Combat Mastery lv Max. You can evolve it to the next level skill if you have the skill evolution materials.]
[You have earned the record of Lv13 Big Mantis.]
Texts momentarily appeared on his retina and disappeared – With those, suddenly, a wondrous strength filled his entire body.

This was level, the system of strength that the creatures in the worlds that have come in contact with the Akashic Records have acquired.
It’s the act of stealing the opponent’s records and even potential by stealing life.

He felt his muscles gaining strength. The millet-sized lump of mana which was emitting faint light inside his heart, was very slightly increasing its size.
This was a truly marvelous and wonderful experience. And the other humanity experienced this for 10 years? He felt as if he was die due to being envious.

‘But from now, I’m no different.’

Yu IlHan landed on the ground and slightly smiled. It wasn’t just because he levelled up but because he was satisfied with his first fight with a monster. It was a different feeling from the animals that he hunted for disassembly. It was more fierce and heavy and thrilling.

The new information and new stimulation that Yu IlHan liked so much, were raising him to new heights. At that moment, Erta spoke with an uninterested voice.

[Did you open your eyes to the pleasure of violence?]
“Yes. I will definitely beat you up some time.”

The square which was full of insect monsters fell into silence again. They didn’t seem to think that their comrade will die so easily.
However that was brief. The monster’s gazes focused on the human that killed the Big Mantis.

[Kih!]
[Kiik kik!]
[Kuiiiiik!]

Perhaps because their camaraderie was strong, even the monsters that attacked other buildings became conscious of Yu IlHan and turned their bodies towards him and showed off their hostility. Their numbers were no less than 40.

While looking at that, Yu IlHan spoke with a calm voice.

“Now that I think about it. I didn’t learn how to fight groups.”
[Just make it up with your body! They can’t kill you with their ability anyway!]

Using Erta’s words as signal, Yu IlHan dashed out. The insect monsters also moved as if they were waiting for that moment.

[Kuiiiiiiii!]

The first one to come at him was a pillbug which rolled itself up to roll towards him! Above it, there was a fly-looking thing that flew towards him while flapping its wings unpleasantly.

Yu IlHan burst the fly’s head first by throwing the desk leg at it, then he took out another short spear from his waist and smashed it towards the pillbug.
With a refreshing sound that sounded like splitting watermelons, the pillbug’s carapace burst away. The desk leg was amazingly still holding out.
[You have earned 700 experience.]
[You have awakened Spear Mastery Lv Max. You can evolve it to the next level skill if you have the skill evolution materials.]
[You have earned the record of Lv11 Big Fly.]
[You have earned 850 experience.]
[You have become level 4. 2 Strength, 1 Agility, 1 Health, 1 Magic increases.]
[You have earned the record of Lv14 Big Vulgare.]
“This is useful!”
[Above!]

They were giant mosquitoes seeming like the fly’s comrades. And it was 3 at once! Yu IlHan jumped using the pillbug’s corpse as foothold while clicking his tongue. After snapping the mosquito’s dangerously developed mouth, he swung his short sword to break its head.
[You have earned 400 experience.]
[You have earned the record of Lv7 Big Mosquito.]

At that moment, one of them swiftly went behind Yu IlHan and tried to bite him. Its mouth touched Yu IlHan’s back the moment he realized it, but unfortunately it failed to see Yu IlHan’s back. For a low level mosquito to pierce it, the tough skin had broken its mouth.

“How dare you!”

While letting go of the mosquito’s corpse, he jumped backwards and swung his short spear. When the short spear which hit cleanly on the mosquito’s mouth and smashed its head just like that and was shot down, the remaining one came at him with hostile flapping sounds, but even its tube was grabbed by Yu IlHan and could only be swung around.

[You have earned 300 experience.]

“Mosquito Strike!”2
[Kuiiiiiiiiiiii!]

Yu IlHan, who landed on the ground while grabbing the mouth of the mosquito, swung it and bullseye’d the giant honeybee that flew at him fiercely.
The mosquito was killed by the honeybee’s sting, and perhaps a honeybee was just a honeybee even after evolving as the honeybee also died just like that. It was truly a brave death.

[You have earned 350 experience.]
[You have earned 580 experience.]
[You have become level 5. 2 Strength, 1 Agility, 1 Health, 1 Magic increases.]
[You have earned the record of Lv10 Big Honeybee.]
[To think it will die with its own attack, it seems like it wasn’t perfectly monsterized. But then, what is this level about…… hm……]
“Fuu, so refreshing!”

When he turned his gaze while ignoring Erta’s mutterings, coincidentally there was a mantis that looked exactly the same as the mantis he killed first, but just 1.5 times bigger, in front of him.
Immediately after he recognized that mantis, its scythes which shined dangerously, swooshed at him with no breaks.

“Tch!”

Yu IlHan, who limboed the scythe threw the short spear backwards in that position to sever the breath of the fly that flew at him from another direction. And when his 2 hands became free like that, he went and did a back flip just like that to distance himself from the big mantis.

[You have earned 380 experience.]

[There are monster reinforcements!]
[Kuiiii!]
[Kuoooooooooon!]

Just where did they hide before coming out? Flies, mosquitoes, mantises, pillbugs, centipedes and even cockroaches! He moved his body while clicking his tongue.

“Heh!”
[Kuik!]

He grabbed the two remaining short spears in both of his hands and swung it without restraint to break open the insects’ heads. The insects that came like a swarm of bees fell powerlessly like mosquitoes in front of mosquito repellent incense.

[You have earned 700 experience.]
[You have earned 550 experience.]
[You have earned 950 experience.]
[You have become level 6. 1 Strength, 2 Agility, 1 Health, 1 Magic increases.]

The body fluids of the insects soaked him but he didn’t mind. What if they were insects? The important thing now was the fact that those monsters were opponents that Yu IlHan could bring out his techniques from the long time of training!
Yu IlHan, who rampaged like a crazy storm inside the monsters was already in a state of half selflessness.

And when some time passed.
Something flashed in front of his eyes.

“Mm?”

The honeybee which was about to sting him couldn’t even scream before falling onto the ground. When Yu IlHan raised his head, he met his eyes with a woman who held his out towards him, no, to be exact, to the honeybee which collapsed over the countless insect corpses.

With a woman who was wearing a cheap H*lk mask which was sold in the underground stationery store in Business Hall.

“No. I’m worse as Ironm*n……!”
[Stop speaking nonsense and kill those monsters!]

As Erta’s point was truly reasonable, Yu IlHan cleaned out the monsters with effort even while pouting. The woman wearing the H*lk mask also emitted lightning bolts from her hands and attacked the monsters steadily. It was a truly strong destructive power.

[That’s an unbelievable amount of mana quantity. How can she grow that much in just one day……]
“Isn’t she levelling up like me?”
[Oh, it may be like that…… How did you know that mana recovers when you level up?]
“Because my stamina is recovering every time I level up!”

When H*lk mask joined the fray, the situation settled down soon. There weren’t many monsters in the first place, and her attacks also had the power to kill monsters in one strike.

But perhaps the military already knew that monsters invaded the school as not a long time later, tens of soldiers on 2.5 ton trucks came. However, the scene they saw wasn’t one a where a square was full of monsters.
It was a scene where a man wearing an Ironm*n mask was splitting the last insect, a centipede, in half with a drop kick.

“I’m sorry. The d*mned truck couldn’t climb the hill……Whoa!?”

[You have earned 1,250 experience.]
[You have become level 7. 1 Strength, 2 Health, 2 Magic increases.]
While splendidly ignoring the soldiers, Yu IlHan muttered as he was flipping the centipede’s corpse.

“Isn’t there some Jewel of the four souls?”
[If you mean a magic stone, there is one.]
“Oh, there really is one?”
[Didn’t you say you learnt dismantling? For insect monsters, you have to take out the hardest part of the carapace, which became like that due to mana, and the magic stone. I will tell you the parts so do it now.]
“Okay. Wait a bit.”

Yu IlHan stepped on the joints of the smallest Big Mantis and pulled out the its scythe. The soldiers who were coming to the square stopped while being frightened after they looked at that scene.

“Who is that guy? What level is he?”
“How did he acquire that much strength in just one day?”
“That was a drop kick!”

Whatever the others said, Yu IlHan started the first monster dismantling of his life. He couldn’t eat the meat so he threw them away, and as Erta said, he took away the hardest part of the carapace and the magic stone.

The scythe of the Big Mantis was very sharp, so when it was in the hands of Yu IlHan, a dismantling meister, it sliced apart the monsters’ corpses as it became a peerless sword.

[You have awakened Dismantling Lv Max.]

The soldiers were obvious and even the H*lk masked woman could only stare at his lively movements dumbfoundedly.
When they confirmed that all the monsters had disappeared, the people hiding inside the buildings also started crawling out but they also couldn’t approach Yu IlHan.

“Is this it?”

While cutting apart the centipede, a small blue stone rolled out. When he picked it up and asked Erta with a small voice, Erta nodded her head.

[It’s a magic stone. The crystallization of mana. It’s a high efficiency energy and at the same time, the origin of every artifacts.]

After Yu IlHan wiped it on the grass on the ground and put it in his pocket, he changed his target. Of course as he was a Korean man with manners, he didn’t touch the monsters killed by the H*lk masked woman. The corpses killed by the H*lk mask had unique traces of a burn so it was easy to identify.

It was not that every monster had a magic stone, and not every one of them had hard carapaces so there were less spoils of war then he thought. There were 8 magic stones with the size of a millet, 3 rice grain-sized ones, 1 soy bean-sized one, and a few carapaces the size of his head.

“Phew……Whoa.”

Yu IlHan raised his head like a farmer that just finished working on his field. But from some time, the H*lk masked woman was staring at him. Without moving from the place she appeared at the beginning.

The people who came out to the square, and the soldiers who came too late, gulped while looking at the confrontation of the two heroes.
It was the meeting of the two strongest in Seoul, no in the country of Korea as a whole, or perhaps even the whole world. How historical was this scene!?

“Uh……”
The H*lk masked woman carefully spoke. It was an unexpectedly calm and unflustered voice.

“Can you…… dismantle for me?”

Yu  IlHan fell into thought for a brief moment before replying.

“How much will I get?”

It was the first meeting of the dropout and the Empress.

',0,'2019-05-01 23:00:01.000000');
INSERT INTO `chapter`(`book_id`,`name`,`data`,`number_of_read`,`upload_date`) VALUES(2,'chapter 8','“30%……No, I willl give you 40%”

At the H*lk mask’s generous declaration, he dismantled her worth without hesitation. The H*lk mask watched him while exclaiming at his high level dismantling technique that moved as if he became one with the mantis’s scythe. Of course, the others weren’t like that.

“That woman! She’s definitely Empress. She became a lot weaker but it’s 100% her with that lightning bolt!”
“She came to school today. She’s a student, right? Look at that body figure.”
“Quiet. If you get close, then you’ll get struck by lightning.”
“That’s what I want!”
“……But who in the end is that Ironm*n?”

As the citizens that they should protect had killed the monsters, the soldiers also stood there dumbfoundedly watching them. The second lieutenant-looking leader was also giving a report while deeply sighing, and the soldiers were all busy sneaking at the H*lk mask’s body figure, while calling her Empress and worshipping her.
He pitied the soldiers, who became soldiers in less than 1 day after 10 years of being in other worlds, but honestly, it wasn’t something that Yu IlHan could care about.

“And so, who’s that Ir*nman?”
“Oh yeah, now that I think about it, what was that attack technique? Did he shoot a beam from his palm?”
“Wasn’t it an axe?”
“He just swung the monsters around, though?”

Yu IlHan’s concealment skill was at a point where it half-distorted reality. He became very willing to retort to every one of those humans speaking nonsense, but he suppressed it and swung the scythe. From the fly’s ass, a magic stone emitting faint light flew into the air.

“Finished.”

Yu IlHan, who splendidly caught that in mid air clicked it towards the Empress and passed it. She received it before politely nodding her head.

“Thank you.”

The 40% worth was already taken by him under the negotiation with the Empress. Their greetings ended and transaction had ended so what was left was just the parting. The Empress put her spoils of were inside a bag she prepared beforehand and started walking after turning back.

“W, wai……Kek!”

Perhaps having received an order from the higher-ups, the second lieutenant approached her, but he solidified after getting struck by a weak lightning before he even approached 3 metres close to her.
The lightning, which could delicately stop movement to make someone stay away without injury, was running at the peak in regards to not only power, but control. If God looked at this scene now, then he would probably shout ‘Yes, this is what I wanted when I sent humans out!’

The gallery, who saw this, whispered to each other.

“Amazing.”
“Looks painful.”
“He must feel good.”
“He got a struck by lightning from the Empress, he must feel good……”
“I want to try getting struck too……”
“Are there only perverts here!?”

Immediately after the Empress left while attracting the gazes of the people, Yu IlHan, who organized his spoils of war, also stood up. He peeled the pillbug’s carapace to use it as a makeshift tray and piled the carapaces on top of it. The 4 desk legs were disposed of a long time ago.

People should start running at him soon, too. It would become a pain to carry his spoils of war out amidst that chaos. But it wasn’t like he could throw away the monster by-products. so what could he do?
Yu IlHan fell into panic like the time he was asked ‘do you like mother, or father?’ from his aunt when he was 5 years old.

However, his agony was meaningless. It was because when the gazes that focused on the Empress turned back to the original position, they couldn’t Yu IlHan’s figure.

“Whoa, where did he go?”
“Amazing, he must have run at a speed we can’t see.”
“SungDaein Bolt……!”1
“SungDaein Bolt!”

Yeah, I knew this would happen.

Even though the situation went as he wanted, Yu IlHan couldn’t hide his complicated emotions. Especially, the fact that the second lieutenant was looking for Yu IlHan with a serious face but couldn’t find him, was heartaching.

He left through the crowd of people while pouting. It was because he wanted to eat his mother’s food.
The time he recognized that he left his bag in the lecture room, was after he came down to the bottom of the hill.

That day, when he came back home (of course, he went back to get his bag), after Yu IlHan ate dinner with his mother, who greeted him overly delightedly due to the monster incident at the campus which was broadcasted to the whole country, and his father, who came home with a scared face due to some incident, Yu IlHan left his house quietly after locking the door while pretending to sleep inside his room. 2

In his hands was a bag which contained the carapaces of the insects he hunted that day and some tools.

[Where are you heading?]
“Anywhere secluded.”

In truth, nights nowadays were all without human figures. It was because the nervousness of Korea, especially Seoul, reached the extreme due to the monsters that brazenly invaded the college campus in the afternoon.

He placed himself inside a random neighborhood playground and spread the carapaces out on the floor.
Yes. He came out to make some defensive equipment himself befitting of Yu IlHan, who couldn’t stay still without doing anything.

“As expected, it it a bit insufficient to make an armor? Moreover, it’s non-metal too…… It should be possible to make if it’s just the wrist and knee protectors.”

He wanted to make an armor by whatever means possible but insect carapaces were too hard to handle. As it wasn’t like he could melt it and process it like metal, so he had to go with a making a DIY furniture feel rather than a blacksmith feel.

But, Erta became worried even at that simple process.

[Monsters’ byproduct’s characteristics are very hard to handle. It’s better to not touch it rashly as there is no proper craftsman on Earth yet.]
“What are you saying?”

Yu IlHan retorted while wearing the work gloves.

“Isn’t the world’s best blacksmith right in front of you?”

[Oh…… Litaaaaaaaaa!]

Erta seems like to like Lita a lot – Yu IlHan uninterestedly muttered before taking out a saw from the bag and started working. But Erta, who was watching him cutting the carapace with resignation, spoke.

[Even so, you were in a world without mana so you don’t know about mana crafting, right?]
“What is that, that awesome sounding name!?”
[It refers to to putting a special power inside a defensive equipment or armor using mana crystals, including magic stones. In other words crafting artifacts.]
“Teach me!”

Yu IlHan’s eyes burned with passion for new knowledge and technique He lifted Erta up before placing her in front of his eyes and shouted as if to hypnotize her.

“Teach me!”
[You’re close, too close! I will teach you so put me back on top of your head!]

He obediently placed her back on hish head. Erta was taking deep breaths to forget Yu IlHan’s face, which came close to the point that she was about to get swallowed up (physically), and spoke.

[As the generalization of the process of making defensive equipment and armors using mana, which is not only on the physical body, strictly speaking, mana crafting is a concept that developed from blacksmithing.]
“I can’t do blacksmithing even if I want to right now. First, tell me the method to create an artifact.”
[Do I owe you something?]
“Teach m……”
[I said I will teach you!]

She would preach a grand sermon to Rita to manage her man properly when she goes back to heaven!

[The ingredients are the materials to create the armor and magic stones, or some other mana crystals of similar characteristics. For example, there would be a dragon HEART.]
“Don’t use something so grand as an example. It make my heart pound.”

Yu IlHan took out the magic stone while complaining. Erta continued speaking.

[First the basic form. You create the gear while putting the magic stone near you. After this process, called ‘synchronization’, and finish creating the gear, you then grind the magic stone into powder to apply it on the gear’s surface and wait for it to absorb.
“Then?”
[That’s it. Artifact masters call this ‘finish’.]
“What finish when it hasn’t even begun! I cannot acknowledge that as work!”

Erta’s words continued as if she predicted that Yu IlHan would complain loudly.

[Of course, there is an applied form. It’s a method used to bestow a special ability and not stopping with just raising the defensive equipment, or the weapon’s capacity.]
“Yes, you should have taught me that!”
[However, this method is not only very difficult for you, it also requires quite a lot of magic stones. Also important is the will of the craftsman.]
“Tell me first.”

Was he really a human who lived for 1000 years? With Yu IlHan, who was stubborn like a short fused kid, in front of her, Erta spoke while carefully selecting her words.

[It’s the same until the synchronization part, but it goes through a process to bestow a directional nature onto the magic stone. This process is called the ‘bestowal’.]
“And to bestow a directional nature?’
[The easiest is for the craftsman to use mana, but even without, you use another magic stone to bestow a will to the magic stone.]

Will. Yu IlHan softly muttered.

[If you want the wielder to become stronger, then you wish for that, and if you want the person to become faster, then you wish for that, and if you want the person to have the ability to defend against fire, then you wish for that, and if you want the person to have the ability to emit fire, then you wish for that. The level of that ability will drastically differ according to the quality of the magic stone, the mana of the craftsman, and the craftsman’s will.]

And so, it was hard for the current Yu IlHan, Erta spoke as if she deemed as such.

It was because whether it was the quality of the magic stone, or Yu IlHan’s mana, or Yu IlHan’s will, in her eyes, it wasn’t above the lowest level.

As Yu IlHan also knew that he didn’t ask her back. Instead, he spilled out the magic stones inside the bag and silently entered work.

Knee guard to protect both of his knees, and wrist guards. He randomly cut, sanded, holed, sanded, connected with a strong leather rope, and sanded.
It was easy to think that it was crude due to being  a product of a simple work, but the protectors that Yu IlHan made were created to fit him, so it looked quite, considerably good.

It wasn’t satisfying in an angel’s eyes, but Erta had no choice but to acknowledge the fact that the equipment he made transformed splendidly to the point that it would be hard to recognize it was once a part of a monster.

After creating defensive equipments, Yu IlHan neatly powdered the rough magic stones, which went through synchronization, and applied it on each ot the protectors.
Despite being a process that he had never done since he was born, all of his movements were extremely efficient and neat. It was to the point that the angel, Erta, thought ‘elegant’ while looking at it.

[Is it a familiar process?]
“It’s not that, but I realized after doing a lot of things until now…… the fact that labor is just finding the trick.”
[If you didn’t say that at the end, it might have sounded cool.]

He spoke as if it was a joke, but that was a huge realization for Yu IlHan. He acquired the ability to see through the most efficient process and apply it in real work no matter what he worked on. It was a power that was applied to not only just simple labor, but smithing, dismantling, and martial arts.

Erta was laughing at it, but if she knew the meaning behind the words Yu IlHan said, then she would be shocked. This was an absolute power which cannot be materialized even as a skill.

[You have learned the skill, Mana Crafting.]

The ‘basic form’ knee guards and wrist guards were completed. Erta was dumbfounded while looking at it and muttered.

[You’ve really made an equipment like this even with those shabby materials……With this level 27, no, you may even be alright in confronting level 30 monsters. Considering your fighting ability, then it should be sufficient.]
“It’s not over yet. There’s still magic stones left.”

Magic stones were definitely left. And it was the biggest one of them, the soybean sized one, and about 4 millet sized ones which paled in comparison.

Erta instantly realized after looking at components. He was challenging ‘applied form’ right now.

[It’s impossible.]
“I’ll try it as experience.”

Yu IlHan also didn’t assure himself that it was possible currently. He was assured that he would be successful some time, if he kept trying.

Yu IlHan achieved success until now like that. Alone, he did all of them.
This was Yu IlHan’s life.

Erta, who realized that Yu IlHan didn’t have any thoughts to stop, shrugged her shoulders and didn’t interfere any further. It was because that the equipments that were already finished were products that surpassed her imagination, and that throwing away some magic stones like that wasn’t that important in regards to safety.

At that moment, Yu IlHan took out something from the bag. The only part which was not carapace from the spoils of war. It was the Big Mantis’ scythe.

[……What are you trying to do?]
“Just watch.”

On one hand, he held all the millet sized magic stones, and on the other, he held the left wrist protector, Big Mantis’ blade, and the soybean sized magic stone.
While looking at Yu IlHan’s incomprehensible actions, Erta questioned if he understood what she spoke or not.

Regardless of whether the angel thought that or not, Yu IlHan focused with closed eyes.

‘By using the mana of the magic stone……will……!’

The millet sized magic stones started lost their light and crumbled apart one by one. Yu IlHan didn’t understand well about mana yet, but this process helped him feel mana more clearly.
He concentrated more, fearing that he would lose the faint feeling that he caught onto.

‘Scythe…..like the mantis……!’

The millet sized magic stones eventually all disappeared. However, the soybean sized one, which was on the brink of failing, seemed to emit light before the scythe started emitting blue light as if to respond to it.

[……Ah, maybe?]

Erta, who knew what was happening by then, ended up thinking that it was disappointing for his attempt to fail just like this.

‘Eii. I don’t know anymore.’

She flowed a tiny amount, a really tiny amount which was unnoticeable by Yu IlHan, into the protector. At that moment, the soybean sized one flashed brightly before it disappeared with the scythe.
What was left was only the left wrist protector.

[Mana crafting increases to Lv2!]

[Did it fail?]
“No.”

Yu IlHan confidently replied before equipping the wrist protector and tightening it.
After confirming that he equipped it properly, he exhaled shortly and rushed towards one of the swings which was swinging near him.

He brushed past it without coming into contact.
However, the moment he brushed past the swing, the two chains that connected the swing were severed and the swing was buried into the sand.

Yu IlHan posed himself immediately and raised his  left arm.

[Oh.]
“You see it, right?”

From the middle of the protector which completely covered the wrist, sharp scythe protruded out at a 90 degree angle to his arm. A sharp scythe which would stay hidden normally and would pop out when he wanted. This was his intention.

“I’ll get busy.”
[Although I did provide some mana, I didn’t know that you would be successful in crafting an artifact for real. You’ve realized its possibility so you will indeed get busy.]
“No, not that.”

Yu IlHan quickly organized his belongings and put his bag over his shoulders. Then started running hard.

“I broke the swing so I gotta run!”
[I will use a recovery magic so get over here right now!]

Yu IlHan still haven’t let go of his habits to treat things roughly, which he acquired during his dropout days.

Author’s notes

1. The reason I’ve mentioned the university name is for the Sungdaein Bolt pun! (Really)
2. Mana crafting is in fact a type of a similar magic.
3. The staff…Erta fixed the broken swing later.

I have something to say to the readers.
It’s about the question I asked you in the last chapter! It’s not about the length of the chapter T^T. No, honestly, you’re saying that the last chapter and the one before that became pointlessly long due to the lack of ability from the author? The chapter may get longer or shorter from normal according to the story’s development. Of course, it’s a problem because it keeps getting longer nowadays…T^T

What I can promise you is enough ‘volume of the story’ which wouldn’t be cut absurdly in the middle of the story! Everyone, please trust in me and follow me!!

Although I may not be able to reply to every one of the replies, I am reading all the comments 2 or 3 times! The reader’s precious opinion, I won’t ignore it! Then I will come back tomorrow at 6 PM!
