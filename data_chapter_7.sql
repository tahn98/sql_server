We were joined by Riguru and the others at the entrance of the forest.
A total of five days were spent on the journey.
But, it’s still within my estimate.
Although we met many problems along the way, the main purpose of the journey was achieved!
On that note, I didn’t see an Adventurer’s Guild in that city; shame, I wanted to take a look at the Freedom Association.
Wanted to see if any of their members are “World Travelers”… but I doubt there are. 

Also, the incident in the Dwarf Kingdom has sadly prevented me from further research on handiwork and armor… well, it can’t be helped.
But, I was satisfied with my new comrades!
And, we earned 20 gold coins. Really struck gold right there… literally.
I introduced Kaijin’s group to Riguru and the rest, and they exchanged greetings.
Since they’ll be working together from now on, I want them to get along.
Come to think of it, the dwarfs seem less prone to discrimination.
Perhaps it has to do with the fact that they are, themselves, a half magical race.

Well, there was a problem in the beginning of our return to the village.
Ranga was waving his tail happily around me. However, when I told him to carry two of the three brothers, his joyful expression quickly turned sour, and he took a step back.
Then, while staring at the duo, he added “Will it be worse off if those two idiots get left behind?”
With a look full of intent to swallow them whole! Which, of course, terrified the dwarfs.
To begin with, when they first saw Ranga,

“ “ “Geeeeh!!! What…. is that…” ” ”

That’s how surprised they were.
Was that the start of one of their performances?
I don’t really get it, but maybe there is something amusing about it.

“Wa.. wait, Ranga! I’m just planning to mimic the black wolf to check its abilities. That’s why I want to leave the two dwarves to you!”

Hearing my words he stood upright as if at attention, and, 

“Acknowledged, my lord!!!”

And he thus consented.
Kaijin and the eldest brother Garm will get on my back.
The middle brother Dold and the youngest Mildo are on Ranga’s.

To ensure their safety, I tied them to Ranga with [Sticky Thread].
After all, in a world with no motorcycles, traveling at 80 kph would certainly be a terrifying experience.
I don’t know if it’s possible to run that fast, and I don’t have any intention to be going that fast…

Next, it’s my turn.

Mimicry: Black Storm Star Wolf (Tempest Start Wolf)

As the mimicry finished, I transformed.

“Amazing!!! As expected of Master!!!”

“Fu ha ha! Even so! Work hard to evolve into this form!”

I responded to Ranga with praise.

“Ay! I will strive to live up to your expectations”

With a new goal in mind, Ranga’s eyes were shining bright.
The other Storm fanged wolves were all just as excited.
Everyone being motivated is surely a good thing.
Then, I glance over to Kaijin’s group.
There’s foam coming out of their mouth… they fainted?
That old man… what the hell they doing…?

Oh well.
Time to put my daily practice to use! I use [Sticky Thread] on my back. I slowly manipulate the thread to tie up Kaijin’s group… and, success! This way, we can continue carrying Kaijin’s group even while they’re fainted. Thus, we depart.
As a side note, I think it’s a good thing that Kaijin’s group had fainted. If we don’t take this slowly, at a speed of 100 kph, they could faint from the initial acceleration…
The two siblings on Ranga’s back, Mildo and Dold, however, seem to endure well… never mind. That’s the rumored “fainting with your eyes open” skill, huh…
I offer my condolences.

The return journey was going smoothly, primarily because the dwarves had fainted.
It’s probably better for them to faint instead of biting their tongues.
In fact, imagine yourself in their position—wouldn’t it be unpleasant to wake up to another terrifying experience?
Instead, isn’t it best to let them sleep with those happy faces?
Well, I’ll wake them up for meals.
I know, I’m a bad person (lol).

Come to think of it…

“Oi, Riguru! Have you succeeded at summoning your black wolf yet?”
“Although it brings me great shame… there has been no progress”

Fumu.
Even Riguru can’t do it.
The other goblins are also frustrated; the wolves, as well.

So, only Gobuta?

“So only that Gobuta succeeded?”
“What! Gobuta, is that true?”
“Yes! I called and he came!”


Hearing those words, the other goblins’ and black wolves’ eyes lit up in determination.

“But, that can’t be. Gobuta is the kind of guy to walk to and from the Dwarf Kingdom on foot!”

Come to think of it, he’s right!
You’d think he’s just a fool! But, I guess he’s the type of guy that can do it when it matters.
Well, Gobuta is a fool, but that certainly doesn’t mean he’s incompetent.
Come to think of it, he made a four month journey on foot alone while scavenging for food; if he were weak, I doubt he could’ve done it.
Thus, my mental evaluation of Gobuta rose. Well, sooner or later it will drop…!

When the night comes, we take a break.

I’m not tired at all, but the others need a break.

While everyone rests, I’ll try out some abilities.
The physical abilities of the Black Storm Star Wolf (Tempest Star Wolf) are really high.
I could feel the power gushing out.
When I kick the ground lightly, I instantly leap into the air, and gallop through the air.
Combined with my reaction speed, I can probably bring out its full potential.
To begin with, most of my battles to date ended with “[Water Blade]!” and the enemy were decapitated.
Since strength and agility are important factors in a fight, this is a pretty good development.
Enough to say that I am satisfied the Tempest Star Wolf’s combat ability.
From what I imitated with [Great Sage], while mimicking the black wolf, I can instantly kill the black snake. Without any special abilities.
I received an explanation on ranks in the town. The Lizard was a rank B-. Via the simulation ability of the [Great Sage], one could approximate the rank of other monsters. The black snake would never reach A rank, but, being able to defeat ten centipedes, one could rank it as A-…
Similarly, a normal—not mimicked—black storm star wolf is stronger than a black snake, but a fight against ten of them would be impossible…

No, wait… there’s that ominous [Black Lightning] skill…
My instincts scream that it’s dangerous.
And yet, I return to being a slime, and try it out.
The result,

Pika~tsu! ……..Chudo—n!!!

Fufufu….
My test target, a big boulder on the riverside, crumbled to dust.

Thus, I judged that I should absolutely never use this skill again!
So,
I didn’t do anything! A lightning just hit there for no reason!
Let’s go with that.
There was another such skill, the black’s snake [Noxious Breath]. I shall also seal it. At least, until I can properly adjust the output.
Especially since it uses a lot of magic power. And, if not adjusted carefully, there’s a high chance of hitting friendly.
That is, more than its power the range was also phenomenal…!
Surrounding the boulder, an area of about 20 meters (65 feet) was turned into glass by the temperature…

Riguru and others rushed over asking if anything was wrong.

“Wooow, a lightning hit right in front of me! How surprising!”

Is how I deceived them.
Seems like the lightning disturbed their rest, making me feel guilty.
From now on, any dangerous experiments must be carried out in some secret location.
Oh well, I got the data.
The simulation in my brain resumed.

With [Black Lightning], even if it is not my version of it, the black wolf can probably win against ten black snakes.

Thus, it may actually be the case that the Black Storm Star Wolf (Tempest Star Wolf) holds power beyond that of an A rank.
A rank monsters, by themselves, can devastate a small city and are thus appointed “Disaster” level.
Therefore, I should refrain from mimicking the black wolf near a city.
And thus, my research continues till dawn…

……….
…..
...

The next morning.
The dwarves wake up with their faces still pale.
Are they okay?

“Are you guys okay?”
“A, aa..., where are we?

As their consciousness become clearer, they were puzzled due to the unfamiliar scenery around them.
I immediately tell them that we were traveling towards the goblin village.

“What did you say?! For a two month journey like this, we need to procure a carriage and food from some nearby town!!!” 

Well, it’s far too late to be surprised
What to say...., let’s ignore it.
Well if think about it. It’s hard for a normal person to understand the distance we had already traveled.

We aren’t in a rush.
So, I take the time to explain our situation to the dwarves.
As for Riguru and group, they are making food.
Goblins cook in one way—they roast.
That’s fine for now. I have no taste buds, after all!
However, when I do obtain them, I should beat good cooking techniques into them.
Can the goblins get used to cultured life?
Whether it will happen or not, I do not know. But, I plan to try out various ideas.
It’d be bad if they can’t properly cook! 

While eating breakfast, we discussed future plans.
I explained to them that we were bound to arrive at the village in two days.

“Impossi…!”


The dwarfs was not convinced

Thus, we resumed our journey.
Along the way, we conversed using [Thought Transmission]. The dwarfs can also use it, which saves us some trouble. [Thought Transmission] is an improvement over basic telepathy, as it is stronger, allows a larger network, can be used during other maneuvers, and has range of about a kilometer.
On the second sprint, the dwarfs cling to our backs without fainting. Seems like they properly prepared themselves beforehand. Since the wind pressure forced them to keep their eyes closed, I made a thin membrane with my thread to protect their eyes. Surprisingly, it works.
I can finally manipulate it to some extent with just thought.
This much is possible when you get used to manipulating magic essence.

While moving on the road, I ask the dwarfs to teach us about some common knowledge.
While the dwarf talking, the goblins excitedly listens.
Then, we adding our common  knowledge from what we hear, then the conversation turns lively. I feel relieved because they become more familiar with each other. In this state, they will get along just fine in the village.
The Dwarf or The Goblin, the origin is same.
The long lived half fairy Dwarf. The short lived half demon Goblin. The difference was only in the course of evolution. But, the goblins rather said it evolution, would it be degenerate?
In other words, the goblin can be said to be the monster version of the dwarf. The Goblin can evolve to hobgoblin, But after evolution, it seems it extend the life span!
Well, it not just that, but that was one of the differences between demon race and fairy race.
Even in the same half fairy races, dwarfs are closer to the demons rather than the elves. 
Maybe that’s the reason, they able become accustomed without discomfort with others once they gets used to it.

Having suddenly remembered something, I decided to ask,

“Kaijin, I know it’s already too late to ask, but is it okay? To have said those things to the Dwarf king, didn’t you admire him?”
“Oh about that. I do admire him! There isn’t a single dwarf who doesn’t. Who wouldn’t admire a hero king that looks like he had come out of some fairy tale?”

Certainly.
Heroes from fairy tales come out only in bedtime stories.
This hero, however, is alive and well, supporting and protecting his people as their King.
Thus, it is exactly as he said—everyone respects and admires him; and, everyone would surely want to be useful to such a King....

Do I have the resolution to do the same?
I became the goblins’ master by pure chance. But, how should I proceed from now on?
It’s fine. No doubt about it!


That’s the kind of “myself” that I wished to become.

“Hey, Kaijin. Why have you decided to follow me? If you think about it, isn’t it far better for you to return to the King’s service?”

Upon hearing this question, this is how Kaijin answered.

“Gahahahaha! Danna (TL note: can mean master but I left it in romaji) is surprisingly tactful! Why? Because it seemed interesting! That’s what my instincts told me. This guy can do anything! And that was it. Don’t you think it’s a fine reason?”

A fine reason… huh?
No doubt about it.

“Fumu You better not complain later. I was famous for working my subordinates hard, you know?”

Anyways, when there’s something I can’t do, I want others to help me; I want to rely on others. But, if you need my help, I’ll see it through.
Even if it was hard, this is what I truly desire inside.

“I know.”

I nodded with satisfaction at his response.




Two days later, we arrived at the village.
Ours objective was achieved: we returned to the village! 
',0,'2019-05-01 23:00:01.000000');
INSERT INTO `chapter`(`book_id`,`name`,`data`,`number_of_read`,`upload_date`) VALUES(7,'chapter 2',' We finally arrived at the goblin village.
We left the village only two weeks ago, but I feel somewhat nostalgic.
Well, rather than calling it a village, it was just a square surrounded by fences...
While we were out on the journey, what’s left was just some small tent for living.
The center of the village is marked by the bonfire; I noticed a big pot placed there.
Roasting! It was the only cooking method before! It seems they improved. What an impressive progress.
That pot over there... if you look at it closely, from it’s appearance it was made from shell of a Ōkame (Big Turtle).
How far did they expand their hunting range...?
Well, it seems they did not get attacked from other monsters, I feel relieved.

Immediately after entering the village, the hobgoblin villagers noticed us. We were greeted by cheers. Unfortunately, I didn’t bring any souvenirs.
Oh well, it seem there many fur, etc from monsters they hunted, I\'m sure the dwarves can turn them to clothes right away! Eventually, I want the goblins to be able to make it themselves.
Now, to introduce the dwarves, I attempt to find Rigurudo so he can gather everyone.
It seems it’s not needed, Rigurudo came running.
But, he had a troubled face.
What had happened? I tried to think the answer of my question.

“Welcome back! I’m sorry I didn’t greet you earlier when you came back, but Rimuru-sama there are guests...”

Even if he tired, he still feel obliged to greet me, I feel sorry.
Guests...? Someone I knew?
Anyway, are the dwarves free in the village? I think they start inspecting around.
The equipment I bought was stored in a vacant tent.
I leave the care of the dwarves to Riguru, I was guided to the place where the guests were waiting.
Rigurudo guided me to into a large tent.
Who is it?
Well, when we meet, I will know. Thinking that, I enter the tent.
I was surprised when I saw what was under the entrance of the tent.
Over there, there are several Goblin.
Some were well dressed with several others that accompany them.
Chiefs, and they escorts? Why they did’t carry any weapons. Even thought I don’t see any problem.
When I was perplexed, the goblins were all suddenly dogeza (prostrate/kneeling)!

“ “ “ We greet you, O Strong one! Can you please hear our humble request!!! “ “ “

They speak all at once.
Strong one? It exaggerated but are they referring to me.
I discerning them all, their saying with serious tone and their eyes were all serious, I knew those eyes.
What are they expecting from me? I thought so.

“Fumu, I’ll hear”

I decided to hear their story.
Then,

“Ah! We are really grateful! Our request is, we want to ask you so we can serve under you!!!”

One of them, answered as the representative.
The other all nodded in agreement.
They asked with hope-filled eyes.

“ “ “ Please take care of us!!! “ “ “

They deeply beg.
Honestly, I thought it was troublesome
Right now, it’s time for the village revival! I don’t have time to spare for you guys!
Although I want to say the otherwise, the fact is the people on this village just a few.
Anyway, I predicted there will be turf wars going around here I think it’s okay to accept them in,
Right now it’s okay, but what if they’ll betray us later?
Although I‘m a bit worried about it, If that happen I will exterminate all of them, I do not forgive betrayal. 
To lead monsters, wishful thinking will only get in the way. Everything must be dealt cold-headed.
I order to determine my resolution, is to accept those guys.
I assured myself again.

Once these guys betray me, I will kill these guys...!

But... now that I think about it, how can I easily think of killing someone?!
I’m surprised by myself.
Oh well, it better to worry about it later.
By the way, it seems those guys are only a representatives, how many people do they have?
To think about it, I must come up with names to give to all these guys all by myself. I let out a sigh... 
Each one of the goblins went back to their own village to bring home the news.
Well then, I hear the story from the remaining delegates.


Listening to the story, I summarize the contents...
First, the cause that began to disturb the order in the forest.
During the raid of Fanged Wolf clan, the village of Rigurudo and others was abandoned, the cause was they could not afford to offer any warriors.

The Orc race, the Lizardman race, and Ogre race!
It was some of the monsters with intelligence in this forest. They began to move in order to dominate the forest.

Even until now, they had skirmish, but they are in tacit agreement so it did not lead into armed clash.
However, that is in response to the situation where the lord of the forest is gone. So far it seems the move to clear away their old resentment. 
Originally, Monster had a nature that likes to show off their power.
Therefore, to clear away the accumulated resentment, each race prepared to move out.
The goblin race is just a weak race, their presence is only for being trampled by them.

Each chief (Goblin) was in panic.
In this state, they will be ruined by involved in the fight.
During the chief meeting, they carried out discussions every day, but they aren’t very intellect.
The discussion ended without resulting with any solution...

Meanwhile, the news of the attack from Fanged Wolf clan was received, well not far from it. Therefore, Rigurudo’s village was forgotten.
However...
Around the time the food stocks become scarce, there came a bad news. It was reported that a new threat in the forest has appeared!
The rumor was about the black beasts and their riders.
Those riders are running within the forest just like it was in plains, they hunted powerful monsters in the forest.
When they received the report, they all were astonished. Who are those riders?
Apparently, that what it looked like for those goblins...
In response of this report, opinion was divided.

The first opinion claims that, any day now, those riders will take them under their protection.
The second opinion claims that, it’s too suspicious! It must be so kind of trap!

The ones who said it’s a trap; there is no reason to bring us into a trap! They didn’t listen when being persuaded.
In addition, even if it’s not a trap, it isn’t necessary for us to accept.
Without intellect only sadness, the words for conclusion can’t come out.
Therefore, they select a person as representative to ask for asylum. They told me that was the reason why they went to this place.


I understand.
Well, it was a good story from a small fries (Alt: bug). However, even if the goblins are small, weak and lack intellect, there will be no one willing to help them.
Either way, I decided to accept their request.
But only those willing to come here.
I told this to the representative of the goblins.
Hearing my word, those goblins went back to their own villages.


For now on there is a problem.
I think that after looking at the goblins that came here.
Isn’t that... A little too much?
In the village’s space, there are only a few accommodations.
Or rather, why I must be worried for such a thing?

For a few days, several axes were created, the newly created axes were used to cut trees, the collected timber was going to be processed, and would be used later to build housing. I leave the charge of the timber related things to Kaijin.
The three dwarf brothers, diligently processed the fur, to make clothes for hobgoblin.
The three dwarf brothers as usual looked at the women (Goburina) with sharp eye.
It might be good, if they finish it quickly!
At the time I told them to hurry their works, goblins came.
From the 4 clans, collectively there is about 500 people.
The rest of it, the opposing faction stayed at the villages.
They choose to stay.
But right now the works is still not done.
That’s what I thought, I then check mind map.
I’m looking for suitable location near water source so I can open farmland.
I walked to the nearest place that meets my condition...
The place is in the vicinity of the cave from beginning.
Fumu.
I called Rigurudo, asking about the situation around that area.

“Around there was nonaggression territory. Because unlike in the forest, inside the cave, there is a nest of powerful monsters...”
“Ah, there will be no problem. I used to live over there.”
“Wha! Is that true!!!”
“No, I was born over there so it okay, there will be no problem at all.”
“....As I expected, degozaimasu na. This Rigurudo, truly admire you”

Is it really great?
I was just born in that cave, why does he have to be impressed with that?
Well, as long as he’s satisfied.
Immediately, I went to talk with the youngest brother from the three brothers - Mildo who had architectural related knowledge.
I and Mildo are consulting about various things.
I told Mildo any knowledge I had related for various constructions from my previous life that I could remember.
The current technology in this world, it measured it is on decent level with magic intertwine together.
In addition of my knowledge I had, I plan to measure and survey the local area.
I want to make some of kind treatment facilities for excrement which was necessary for goblins and dwarves. But it’s not necessary for the black wolves.
Anyway, you can make an underground sewer, or fermenting the excrement I thought it good as fertilizer.
But when seen from sanitation side, it was common sense that it would easy for it to become the source of infection for infectious disease. That was what Mildo said to me.
Well, can monster like goblins become sick? It’s what I thought, but it seems it normal for getting epidemic.
It’s fate of weak monsters.
Well, if it’s because poor sanitation, they would surely became sick...
In case of the goblins, the number of birth exceed the number that die because the strong fertility, it seems it possible to maintain the numbers.
But, by evolving, it seems the fertility had depleted.
In exchange for that, it seems the life span extended.
Mildo was well informed. Though he didn’t knew much in topics related to processing the excrement.
I confirmed that there was only a few “World Travelers” in this world.
In this world, had it own unique knowledge about Spirit Engineering, I heard it’s mysterious and there weren’t many explanations about it.
Because there weren’t many details known regarding the benefit of the excrement, he was surprised when listening to my story.
Thus, the conclusion of the meeting, Mildo was appointed as the captain of the construction team.
I let him take care of things that were his specialty.
To Rigurudo, I instructed him to assign some people under Mildo, to go survey the project site.
Ranga also accompanied them just in case.
I think the monsters from the cave will not go out, but there is a possibility. If that happen I’m sure Ranga can take care of it.
Thus, Mildo and others, the construction team departed.


The next was, naming.
The though is too depressing. To gave name one by one for all 500 people. Any longer, I think it would turn to the forbidden A B C D.
But I don’t like to do something halfhearted.
Immediately, I started giving them names.
Again, I went to low activity state after giving them all names, but I was able to give name to everyone.    
The fatigue was less than the previous naming; it is something that you do not want to do again.
I summon the chieftains.
They all kneeling in front of me, were the evolved chieftains
Led by Rigurudo, Rugurudo, Regurudo, Rogurudo.
Obvious, side by side. It’s Ra Ri Ru Re Ro.
Coincidentally, Ra became Ranga.
I think it all appropriate, so it’s okay! There is no one that object.
I thought it in frantic! I forget about the names appeal.
I will work very hard! It’s was one of a good man appeal!!!
The one that are left over was a female.
It’s possible to determine the gender of Goblins, but it hardly shows in the appearance. But when they evolve the differences is recognizable.
I thought some feminine name, Like Ririna.
In the future, I wonder if this name can become series or not?
Although such idea crossed in my mind, I decided to against such thought.
It’s not needed right now.

Well, in front of me the hobgoblins. I wonder if they capable with hierarchical relationship or not?
Everyone is friends, everyone is equal! Those things were impossible in real life.
In particular, for monsters that emphasizes on power... A clear chain of command was necessary.
I decided.

“Listen, I bestow to you guys this positions!”

It was declared.
Rigurudo was promoted to Goblin King.
And, the remaining chieftains become Goblin Lord.
In the surroundings, all of the goblins in the village prostrate themselves; I gulped my own saliva when watching such spectacle.



“ “ “ Wa ha~a!!! We humbly receive your order!!!” “ “

With that word as the signal, thunderous cheer rose up.
A new history for goblin has begun.




For crafting tools, Kaijin had prepared it.
For clothes, under the command of Garm and Dold, had been produced steadily.
For timber, it steadily provides the village with vacant land.
By the time it was confirmed that all of the goblins had evolved, the planned construction for the new village began after Mildo came back after the survey.
All were well.
I checked the construction area for the new village.
From it’s scale, it should be called town rather than a village.
Our new home.

After confirming all the preparations and equipment, we all departed.
Towards the new place, step forward.
For our first step to create a new country!

INSERT INTO `chapter`(`book_id`,`name`,`data`,`number_of_read`,`upload_date`) VALUES(7,'chapter 3',' Bordering the Great Jura Forest, was the Count territory of Falmas Kingdom.
On this frontier existed those willing to protect the area.

Their main forces consisted of a knight order under the control of the Count.
Although the members usually only consist of 100 people, the Count declared a state of emergency. Those who had retired were recalled, and the numbers were now nearly three times than the usual, with 284 people.


The next largest force here was the Adventurers from the Freedom Association.
They had taken requests to hunt monsters threatening the land in the vicinity.
However, this was not an urgent matter. And, naturally they finished the request without any difficulties.

To serve as lookouts around the Count’s territory, mercenary were hired.
Although some were talented, many were still just novices. Thus,when the monsters started to move, they all were employed to scout the surroundings.
However, in reality, they didn’t treat their work seriously. The main cause of which being the fact that Count Nidol Maigam had been stingy with money used to employ them.

So, who can subdue the monsters if the Free Association didn’t take the request?
Normally, it was the job of the Knights.
However!

“Fools! When the Knights leave the territory, there is a chance for the cities to be attacked?!!! Who will protect the Town?!!!”

So, the frightened Count did not permit their dispatch.
Money was a problem. Moreover, The Knights could not move in order to protect the town.
Further, complaints came from villages.
They complained about damage caused by monsters that neither the adventurers nor Count did anything about…
However, the Association in this case, can’t receive a subjugation request due to a single rule.
The circumstances involved did not allow it to so easily accept.
 After all, if you going to hunt for rank “B+” monsters, multiple adventurers of the same rank are needed (At least 3 or more people).
Even if 10 adventurers with rank B tried to subdue it, even if they were successful, there would surely be casualties.
Furthermore, just because a sighting was confirmed, it didn’t mean that the subjugation can be begin immediately.
Normally, there was not many rank “B+” Adventurers stay at the frontier; the problem was that monsters would appear too frequently.
Thus, they were unable to effectively move between requests. 
They’d receive the request, subdue the target, and then come back. The time involved between each step became a problem.
To patrol the village, an organization responsible for subjugation was necessary.

In response to these circumstances, reluctantly the Count Nidol Maigam set up an organization.
He called it, Frontier Garrison. Its member consisted of 30 people.
Moreover, they mostly consisted of criminals charged with trespassing on private property, disorderly behavior, or small-time violent crimes.
So, it’s actually a facility for small miscreants. A correctional institution.
They were servants of the Knights, at times; and, they served as opponent for the Knights mock battle.
Thus, their service was meant to rehabilitate them. They choose a person among them as their captain (or rather, they were forced to choose), and were sent as guards of villages.
For Count Nidol Maigam, the plan looks appealing because it not only can solve the villages’ problem.
Even if they had died, his wallet wouldn’t suffer.
It’s the extent of his plans that he doing, but.....

“Fumu, sly dog. Well, to gain our freedom, we should accept it graciously!”

The man named Youmu said.
Due to his appearance,
Originally, he had not wanted to merely end up as a small miscreant.
He hoped he can become the boss of the back streets/slums, but it seems the world didn’t let this man take the center of stage.
Later, the Frontier Guards led by him showed a remarkable results, and he became the frontier villages’ savior.





Fuze.
Belonging to a small kingdom Burmund, he was the Freedom Association Burmund branch guild master.
His former ability as Adventurer was upper rank “A-“. He was a remarkable Adventurer.
As he promised to Baron Belyard, he immediately, conducted his own investigations.
As a result, in response to a report from the information section, it seems there were no movements in the Empire.
But it didn’t mean that the Empire wouldn’t move later........so he had concluded.
Thus in the future, they should continue observing the Empire.
It’s not work that they normally do, but there was no other choice. It’s his decision.
Then, the news from the Investigation Team was received.


When he entered the room, he slowly sat on the sofa.
Their confidential discussion was set to be held in the drawing room.
On the sofa facing him, sat there three people—two men and a woman.
They were Adventurers with a B rank.
Excelling in covert operations, Gido.  With his job as “Thief”, is a man with excellent information gathering skills.
Outstanding in defense, Cabal. With his job as “Heavy Warrior (Fighter)”, his role was that of the tank. He enjoyed goofing off, but was polite when working.
Specializing on particular magic, Ellen. With job as “Magic Spell User (Sorcerer)”, Skilled in diverse magic, but excellent with Movement-based magic. Carefully providing support in order to increase the survival rate of the Party. They were all noteworthy individuals.
They were the team that was ordered to inspect the cave where Veldora was sealed.
His first thought was, please come back safely!
To begin with, the proper level of that cave was rank “A-“.
Actually he wanted to do it himself, alone. But, because of his responsibilities as the guild master, he cannot move freely.....
Meanwhile, the other rank “B+” Adventurer were not asked to inspect the current situation of Veldora.
The reason they were requested was because of their high survival rate and high information gathering capabilities. Rather than during subjugation, if they were sent to collect information while avoiding battle, their abilities surpassed those of other rank “B” Adventurers.
However, if something were to happen to them, it would be his fault.
It was an obvious violation, since him as the branch chief himself had ordered them.
But, it was absolutely necessary for them to check.
That is why, the one who most pleased with their return, was Fuze.

“Let’s hear the report.”

Fuze, never showed emotion in discussion ordering questioning.
He was grateful in his mind; but he didn’t express it in words.
The trio were familiar with this trait

“All I hear is “Wasn’t it tough?””
“I want to quickly take a bath....”
“It was tough; it was hard to mediate the quarrel between Danna and Nēsan, I thought I would be easily trampled to death....”

That was their typical reaction when reporting their findings.
However, their faces were serious.
And then they started the report.

Battle with monsters in the cave.
The guardian, having deceived the Storm Snake’s (Tempest Snake) senses, they removed the seal on the door and entered.
Confirmation of the disappearance of Veldora...
Inside the door, they investigate for about a week, but could not confirm the presence of any living thing. 
And, the most curious detail.....

“And, that. After we concluded the investigation on the inside, the Storm Snake was nowhere to be found!”
“That’s right! Since I can’t use any withdrawal type magic indoors, I spent many hours planning our escape from the Storm Snake… but it was all pointless!!”
“I was just thinking that I’d be able to mix illusion magic and heat manipulation as a decoy! But, no… On a serious note, I worried that although we were able to get here, we won’t be able to get out, but…” That’s what they reported.
Heck, what was that thing? That was a monster of rank “A-“. It was the strongest presence inside the cave.
Probably, I would not win on my own against that monster.
That was precisely why; the probability of success in this mission was greatly reduced.
Fuze thought so.
Again, what is happening in the land? At the moment, that was not something to think about. So Fuze concluded.

“Well you guys. Have a nice break for three days. After that, once again, I want you guys to investigate the forest!This time, it is not necessary to enter the cave! I want you guys to investigate the surroundings thoroughly, and carefully! So, go!”
“I’ll go! See you!”
“What? Three days!!! Give me more rest please~!”
“Hey hey..... Anyway, I guess it useless no matter what I say?

Although they said those things, Fuze did not care.
It was more important to organize the information they brought.
Heck, what was happening in that forest?
Fuze was deep in thought
When he opened his eyes his mood changed, He glared at the three people.

“What you guys doing? Get out!”

Saying that, he drove off the trio.






Sakaguchi Hinata was bored. 
Assigned to guard the inside of the palace of the Holy Ruberion Kingdom, She was her private chambers, alone.
This world was boring.

When she first came to this world, Hinata was still 15 years old.
On the day of her first year high school entrance ceremony, she was on her way home but didn’t particularly want to come back.
When she passed by the shrine she always stopped by, a strong wind suddenly blew throughout it.
The wind forced her eyes shut.
Once she opened them, an unfamiliar scenery had spread before her.
Hinata rejoiced.
Her mother was a religious addict, and now she had been released from it.
Her father, had long ago “disappeared”.
He lost great sums on horse races, and left them with an enormous debt.
Mother fled to religion because she couldn’t withstand the beatings from father.
After careful planning, Hinata killed her father as to help her mother and receive life insurance money.....
After a bit more, the insurance money would be paid out.
The secret had not been exposed.
Thus, her father was treated as a missing person. Thank goodness.
Oh well, if you think about it, in this state it seems necessary to commit another murder.
To murder the zealot who pushed her mother into religion, and sooner or later, end her own mother.
Hinata was calmly analyzing the situation.
That’s why, she didn’t want to stay at home.....
In this place, there was no need to kill anymore. She thought so.....


“Oi! There’s one here!”
“Oh! A young woman! Good job!!”
“Before we sell her, how about we have a taste first?

While speaking such words, some men had surrounded Hinata.

Ah....., even in this place, there is a need.

The world was full of despair.
So she thought.
The world was full of ugly people, that kind of world, I shall destroy it!!!

I, shall take it. I will surely usurp it all!!!

<Confirmed. Acquiring Unique Skill [Usurper]...... Success>

I am righteous. There are no faults in my calculation. There never have been!
That will never change.
<Confirmed. Acquiring Unique Skill [Mathematician]...... Success>
Suddenly, my vision became clear. My hazy mind cleared and my mind got sharper..
In front of my eyes was someone that wanted to steal from me; I’ll steal from them instead. Their life!
Thus, a slaughter took place.
By the hands of a girl, the time she took to kill the three men didn’t exceed 5 minutes.
The physical abilities of the girl who just got her powers, was still not really high.

With cold eyes, she evades the opponent’s attack with minimal movement.
She grabbed the collar of her opponent, and without hesitation gouged out the opponent’s eyes.
Hooking her finger in his eye socket, she pulled the legs of the groaning man down and slammed his head on the ground as he fell.
She pulls out the knife from the fallen man’s waist, and stabbed his throat.
Now, one person down.
The other men were stunned by the situation; and, without waiting for them to put their guards up, she grab sand and threw it at them.
The sand entered their eyes, causing one man to momentarily go blind, she landed a kick on him.
The man fainted.
Without a second glance, she went around behind another man, and shoved the knife through his back, into his heart.
As intended, it pierced the heart through the gap between the ribs. She pulled out the knife, and gushing blood taintedHinata.
Pleasant warmth of blood.
The men, of course, could not comment, being dead.
But, there was one who was still alive.
Hinata approached the fallenman and squatted down near him.
He was terrified, but still alive.
Still, there was a possibility that they had more companions.
She grabbed his hair and lifted his face up     .
And used the Unique skill [Usurper].
Memory and techniques. All of it was taken from the remaining wreckage of a man.
Hinata glanced at him, and stabbed the knife into his neck.
Even she though she kills, she knew basic mercy.

It was her first murder in this world.
From the people she killed from then on, she took their knowledge and techniques.
Now, with the techniques as the foundation, she became a strong person in this world.
From then, 10 years had passed.
Other than that, she didn’t remember the people she had killed.
Good guys, bad guys, Hinata killed them equally.
Because everyone were equal in front of God.
Ridiculously, over here she can kill all of them.
So, over here, she was no longer a normal girl.
Completely remembering the murder.
“Leader of the Imperial Guards under the Pope’s direct command”, she was a beautiful woman that holds the title of Holy Knights leader.
That’s why, it now became impossible for her to move as she wanted.
Please someone, raise a rebellion somewhere.
She thought such a thing.
And then, someone knocked on her door.



“Excuse me, His holiness Cardinal Nicolas Schpeltas came to visit you. Do you wish to meet him? What should I tell him?”

Nicolas?
Sure, he was attached to me......

“Let him in.”

Hinata decided to meet Nicolas.
She was going to kill some time with her faithful dog.

(Hopefully this will kill some time.......)

With a smile of a saint, so she hoped.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Author note:
The purpose of Adventurers Rimuru meet at the cave was investigation.
Unique skill “Usurper” and “Mathematician”.
Its abilities is very similar with the protagonist’s skill

INSERT INTO `chapter`(`book_id`,`name`,`data`,`number_of_read`,`upload_date`) VALUES(7,'chapter 4','Silence was suddenly broken.
Cracks ran along the surface of her mask, and magical power gushed from within.
Slowly, Shizu rose, and began to mutter.

“Summoning magic?!”

Ellen exclaimed in surprised.

“Oi oi, seriously? What rank she going to summon?”
“...., Uh, looking at the scale of the magic, it’s going to be monster with rank “B+” or higher.”
“Dan’na-kata, do not say things so leisurely, it can’t be stopped!!!”

As expected from skilled Adventurers.
They ended the conversation in instant, and then spread out.

“First! Refrain her! Mud Hand"

“Uoooooooo----rya!!! Heavy Collision (Knock Down)”

Ellen makes rope to tie her, while Cabal launches a technique with his body.
Guido was an equally important member; he immediately assumed guard.
Fumu.
Although they are only rank B, their team work is first class.
There is no wasted movement.
But,

“Haaaa----! Explode!”

Shizu swung her finger, pointing first down and then up.
And then, a small scale explosion centered on Shizu occurred.
Shredding my tent to pieces.
The tent aside, are any of the three injured by that explosion?
As I wasn’t harmed in the slightest, I wondered about them.

While attempting to Knock Down Shizue, who had been restrained with Mud Hand, Cabal was blown away by the explosion.
The lookout Gido sensed danger and was able to push Ellen away, saving both of them.

“Oi, you guys okay?”

I ask them.

“Ah, we’re okay!”
“Wait ~u, all my body hurts! I better receive injury compensation!”

So, the two responded.

“O o it hurts-….. You guys…..Please worry a bit about your leader!”

While complaining, Cabal stood up. What a sturdy guy!

“I knew Shizu-san could use magic, but even summoning…?”
“The heck she was saying?

“No, no… don’t worry about that. As far as I know, for a summoner to use a chant is unheard…”

Guido stop moving when saying that, then,

“Eh……, no way…….. Explosion Monarch?”

In any case, the situation is just as I had thought.
Shizu continued to chant. As her body continued to emit red light, something began to emerge.
Her mask slightly rose, and black hair freely flowed before it.
What is her goal? For her appearance to become so strange suddenly…

“Rigurudo! Help evacuate everyone! Bring them someplace safe!”
“But…”
“It’s an order! When you finish the evacuation, call Ranga over here!”
“Ay! I have received your order!”

Rigurudo immediately began the evacuation.
From what I can see, the goblins won’t be of any help here. And, I don’t plan to see them slaughtered pointless.
Nor did I call Ranga to fight Shizu.
The reason is simple.
Perhaps these adventurers have merely set up this play to create an opportunity to strike at us.
Thus, the massacre they plan to beset upon us enabled them to so freely discuss those things (no matter how trivial it actually was).
So when we encircle Shizu, they could strike at us from behind.

“Oi, Gido! Explosion what-now, who’s that?”

Quickly answering his question,

“That is, someone who was active 50 years ago, a hero-like person?”

Ellenreceived such response.
Someone famous? The moment I thought so,

From Shizu’s face, the mask fell.

The flame rose as the wind.
It swallowed Shizu, and from within a Flame Giant had appeared.
Summoning Magic “Flame Giant (Ifrit)”! The ruler of flame swallowed all things.

<Unique skill “Shapeshifter” activate>

Voice of the World resounded.

Then, Shizu’s body and the Flame Giant (Ifrit) fused as one.

“Ge~e!!! It’s Ifrit, A high ranking Spirit with a rank over A!!!”
“Wow...., first time I see it! So~, no way to win against it, huh~!!!”
“There’s no doubt about it..... She’s the Explosion Monarch!”


Fu~u-----!  Don!!!

Impact and heat slowly approach us.
It seems the trio tried putting up a Magic Barrier, but they were blown away with a single blow.
Although they didn’t die, there clearly harmed.
Conscious, but unable to move.
In any case, they are fighting for real. No question about it.
And so, I can officially ignore the possibility that they came here to wreak havoc.
But, wow, that skill has considerable power.
Releasing bottomless magical power, with the Flame Giant (Shizu) in the center, a scorching wind surrounded her with a diameter of 30 meters.
This fellow, if I don’t fight, I’m a goner.
However, there was something strange.
Even in this situation, I did not feel any fear. Did becoming a monster cause such a change? I did feel fear of Verudora and the black snake, maybe I’m just using them as a comparison.

“Oi.  What’s your objective?”
“Fu~u---!”

Ka~tsu!

Shock!
Unlike the previous explosion, she radiated a heat wave this time. However, I had already moved from that spot.
With my perception speed, even if something moves at the speed of sound, I could evade it!
Rather than the previous explosion, the heat wave came toward as radiation. However, I already avoid the wave.
On a side note, I’m glad we haven’t built the city yet. Those were my sincere thoughts.
Moreover, with all the trees cut down, we fought in an open area. Had we been inside a forest, it would’ve caught on fire, causing me much trouble.

However, don’t get carried away!

Bishun!!!

I take aim at the abdomen, and shot “Water Blade”.
But the attack, just before reaching the Flame Giant (Shizu), evaporated. A maelstrom of flames surrounded the Flame Giant (Shizu), protecting it.
Mumu... so it seems “Water Blade” cannot pass through it.
Would firing at full power be a good idea? So I thought, but then I imaged a steam explosion. Yeah, that won’t be fun.
Guess I have to resort to this.
At that moment, Ranga had arrived.

“You called? My lord!”

For now, I ordered Ranga to retrieve the three.
Then,

“Good, quick retreat to a safe place! I’ll defeat it!”

Although he nearly rejected that order,

“I will do as My Lord said, I wish for your fortune in battle!” 

With those words, he left while holding the three people in his mouth.
Now I can fight without reserve.

The flames rage around her.
Using my perception ability, I accurately grasp the distribution of heat within it.
Although the Flame Giant (Shizu) was creating clones of itself and sending them to attack, I could easily predict the danger resulting from the flame’s temperature.


Against me, that attack will never land.
But at the same time, my attack will have no effect.
What a troublesome flame that is.
The ground turned into magma… the temperature inside must be unbelievably high.
Thus the problem: to use skills like [Paralysis Breath] or [Noxious Breath], I’d need to come within ten meters of the target.
I can’t just stroll into that place.
To begin with, such as [Paralysis Breath] or [Noxious Breath], it would be necessary for the target to be within 10m when it was used.
In that high temperature, it would only be a bother! I cannot afford to do that.
I don’t want to class change into a Charred Slime.
What should I do… neither of us can cause decisive damage on the other
If this is how it ends, I should have predated more…

While I was deep in thought, a magic circle appeared below my feet!

Dangerous!

By the time my intuition scream so, I was already trapped.
Wide Area Capture Barrier. Is this a special skill of the Flame Giant (Shizu)?
Without a single chant, the magic circle instantly appeared.

With a range of 100 meters, my body will soon turn into vapor (gas), and be consumed by the scorching heat of the flame.
It’s the strongest fire range attack!

“Flare Circle”

She said, with voice neither feminine nor masculine, young, nor old.
This is... there was no escape!

I was prepared for death.
Aa… I was sure I hadn’t let my guard down, but I feel like I could’ve done something.
Maybe depending on everybody without trying to look cool…
Or mimicking the black wolf, using its speed, and piercing through the heat.
Not wait for it to move first, not do something stupid, try to hit it with [Black Lightning]… should’ve tried any one of these!
Etc…
However, although my perception speed should be 1000 times the norm, I just don’t sense the damage.
Well, maybe dying without pain is a good thing.
But seriously, isn’t this too slow?
S&M play?
Strange…
I’m sure I was engulfed by the fire.
Hmmm….


<...Solution. Due to Heat Fluctuation Resistance EX, the fire attack has been nullified>

Somehow, I had forgotten about Heat Fluctuation Resistance EX! Is what I felt.
Don’t reply to every one of my thoughts! Stupid!
To such abuse, I could feel it respond with a […..].
Though I’m surely just imaging it.
There\'s no way [Great Sage] has developed its ego.
Hahaha.
Definitely just my imagination.
So no problem!

Well, now.
Oi oi, it disables fire attacks?
What? Did somebody set the mode to super easy?
Is everything going according to plan?
“I’m doomed!” I cried, but soon the tables turned! Just as the theory teaches!
In any case, I can now end this fight quickly.

“Now, what should I do?”

I proceed to secretly, entangle the flame giant (Shizu) with [Sticky Steel Thread].
In just a bit, it’ll be my win.
I made [Sticky Steel Thread], a combination of the Sticky and Steel Thread, which I created from days of diligent practice.
Additionally, my resistance seems to be indefinitely active. In other words, I’m not taking damage.
Checkmate.

“Imp, Impossible!”

For the first time, signs of fear revealed themselves in her voice.

I underestimated you, but you too underestimated me.
This I’ll forgive, as we are both at fault
So, you’re free to resent me!


“Is it my turn next?”

Ku~stu! The flame giant (Shizu) tried to make her escape. However, I had predicted that action.
There is no escape from my [Sticky Steel Thread].
Thus, I slowly walk to her.
To deliver the finish blow...
On the Ifrit.. who had probably possessed Shizu and manipulated her body.
And without panicking.
Unable to run away nor even struggle, such a pitiful creature I approach.
And Then,

<Do you want to use Unique Skill “Predator”? YES/NO>

The answer, of course, is YES!

The dazzling light wraps around us.... and then suddenly disappears.
The remaining actors: me and an old woman.

INSERT INTO `chapter`(`book_id`,`name`,`data`,`number_of_read`,`upload_date`) VALUES(7,'chapter 5','Shizu-san said.
She passed me her life’s only goal.
Now, to realize the goal that befalls me, I must start to gather information about “Demon Lord”.
I had accepted it easily, but the promise I made must be fulfilled.    .
I am a man who keeps his promises.

She left me with a new ability.
Unique Skill ”Shapeshifter” and Extra Skill “Fire Manipulation”.
Incidentally, it seems I also ate Flame Giant (Ifrit).
Even though it wasn’t my enemy, this guy is still dangerous.
After all, this guy surpasses rank A.
Without a question, neither Black Snake nor Black Wolf would be able to win against it.
I need to research its abilities, little by little.

But before that!
There was something more important that I need to check right now.
Right! Humanization!!!
I enter a simple tent, newly set up for my personal needs.
No one can enter! I said and closed the door.

Ku kuku, Kuha ha, Ku ha hahaha!

I correctly execute a three-stage laughter. (TL: it likes how villains laugh. Like the one Verudora use in chapter 3.)

“Traaaaan~ form!”

Although there aren’t any sound effects, executing Mimicry: Human!
It’s a first time I’m looking forward to the mimicked body this much.
However,

............ What?

Oyaoyaoya.....
The black fog that always appeared during mimicking didn’t come out.
What’s going on! So, I thought, but my eye level became slightly higher.
I could also feel hands and feet.
And, my skin color changed from the normal pale blue.
Mu, mu mumu?
Though I don’t really get it, I feel somewhat different than from what I had intended.
It’s a shame that there was no mirror.
However,
Although, I don’t want to admit it but I remember once feeling the same way.
A long time ago… around 30 years ago.
Feels just like when I had been attending elementary school.
I wanted to stop to think for a bit.
But there was something I had just notice; there was a big difference.
It’s gone.
In the new form I had taken, my Son had been missing....!!!!!!
What is the meaning of this?
I panicked.
I immediately went to check.
Thus, I came to know a shocking fact....
No...., none.
Smooth, there was nothing.
We~ll well, if you think about it, when I mimicry monsters, I had never wondered about such things.
With no need for excretion, I can’t be expecting to suddenly have those organs, can I…
An obvious truth… I, who doesn’t reproduce, has no need for reproductive organs.
The answer......, the state I in right now, the fact was.....
With deep sense of loss, I understand! Suddenly a worry beset me.
No way! I try checking my head in a hurry. It had bushy and soft feel.
I let out a sigh of relief.
I don’t look like an alien or some suspicious person… thank goodness!
Come to think about it, the black wolf’s fur was also bushy.
Just imagining a fur-less monsters makes me feel bad.....
Stop. Any further thoughts may prove dangerous.
Now, had I, who always maintains a cool head, became flustered?
By this time, I had already accepted the thing regarding my son.
However, it’s rather painful that I can’t check this body......
And then, a nice idea comes to mind. Can I use “Clones”?
As expected from myself.
Whether it’s possible to use in this state—I don’t know; but, let’s try it.
Black fog gushes out from my body, it gathers in front of my eyes and turns into human form.
In a moment, it completed.
This....  is dangerous
It’s dangerous, in many ways

First the appearance.
The figure is lovely silver haired, beautiful girl? Or beautiful boy? It’s natural because there is no sex, but....
In any case, the features were more like those of a girl.
Probably, because the original body was Shizu-san’s, my genes were nowhere to be seen.
That was, well… probably to be expected.
A lovely child, standing naked. Well, there are no parts to be hidden…
But that’s not the problem, this seems morally dangerous.
But, the insanely cute face. To Shizu-san > GOOD JOB! Let me say that.
I was a Nice Guy, but never this beautiful.
Thus, I honestly thank you.
I was wrapped in fur, and the clone also appeared with it.
Right now, I still had not prepared any clothes.

The reason why it’s dangerous was.
Because of its abilities.
The clone had excellent thinking capabilities, and completely linked to me.
Which mean, both are me.
There is no difference between the main body and the clone.
No, the ability of the flame giant (Ifrit)’s clones clearly are inferior.
Yet, I feel that my clone are not inferior. No, I wonder if it is lacking.....
There are differences.
In the magic power capacity. Originally the amount of magic power you can use is limited. It can’t use more than originally given to it.
It’s possible to keep giving it more magic power, however.
I have quite a lot of magic power. Depending on how I use it, it can be pretty powerful.
However, the flame giant (Ifrit)’s created about 10 clones,whereas my high performance clones are limited to a single body.
Though, if seen from opponent’s side, it’s definitely a cheat.

The last reason.
There was a lack of discomfort when mimicking..
I noticed it when the black fog did not occur.
For example, black wolf.
When turning into the black wolf, the mimicry configures it inside the black fog. But, it’s inferior to slime’s body abilities.
Even though slime’s body doesn’t have limbs, there are no restrictions on its physical movement, because the cell abilities were abnormally high.
Each one of the cells is muscle, brain, and also nerve.
Do you get it? The eye transmits information that the brain then processes.
But the slime avoids this process.
With “Great Sage” correction my perception speed are 1000 times the norm. Thus my reaction speed, is far about the ordinary person.
However, the body created inside the black fog has some lag-time—for the thoughts to reach the brain=actual brain.
Perhaps,the drop in quality of the clone was caused by this.
But, mimicking the human being does not release black fog....?
Because its reaction speed is equal to the slime. Thus, no discomfort.
And, due the fact that there are limbs now, its motor movements are better… But, it’s a child.
Still, it’s easier to move than as slime.
Also, because there no need for black fog, there is no need to consume magic power.
From now on, let’s try considering this as the main form! So I thought.
　
Suddenly I got an idea, so I issue an order to the clone.
To change itself, smoothly.
The clone began to growth!!!
The physique becomes slurry. Fluttering Silver hair. Beautiful, medieval looks
Perfect!
Furthermore from it, it can change into woman or man of any type.
It can become macho or fat, it also can became young man or old man.
I found it possible to mimic into variety of conditions. Also, the reason for the black fog was apparently to accommodate the additional mass, so turning into an adult requires it.
This might be good as I can thus enhance my physical strength.
Although the reaction speed decreases, it is more advantageous to have larger strength.
Well, speed are also one of the more important elements in a fight! So, I think.
From then on I carried out more experiments, and got used to this body’ abilities.

Thus I, in this world,got my hands on a human body!

Three days have passed since we departed.
We had been able to reach the marshes.
Since we couldn’t replenish our water reserves along the way, I had used the water from my stomach, but it seems to also have filled everyone with power.
Come to think of, since it constantly flows within my magic power, this just may be the water’s acquired effect.
When departing we focused on minimizing luggage to maximize speed.
Thanks to that, we were able to arrive sooner than expected.

Before we continue our advance we must confirm the current situation.
The meeting with the Lizardmen’s Chief is scheduled for tomorrow, and we have yet to have any cause for concern.
Thus, I ordered everyone to standby and take a break. Tension filled the air.
Now, for the reconnaissance…

[Rimuru-sama, I shall go.]

Souei immediately offered.
He was not wearing any armor. Instead, he was wearing a chainmail woven from my steel thread.
No questions about it—it was built for agility.
According to him, I won’t be hit, so there’s no need! Such were the smug and brisk words of this handsome guy.
I see… I somehow managed to reply.
This time too, I can entrust this mission to him with confidence.

[Okay then, Souei. Go, confirm the situations for me.
   If possible, go check how good the ability of the pig boss is!]

Saying so, I sent him out.
Surely, he will discover many interesting things with his exceedingly high ability.

[Rimuru-sama, would you mind if we rampage as we liked this time?]
Benimaru had asked.
Frankly, since I had no idea about the situation I couldn’t say. Thus,

[Hmm? I don’t mind, but can you properly withdraw once I order the retreat?]

So I say.
Benimaru sported a fearless smile.

[That signal, I think it would be unnecessary? After all, it will be annihilation! Won’t it?]

Such self confidence. You too, huh! So I thought.
Good men are full of confidence, was it… if we win…
Was acting so smug but lost anyways! Were that to happen, the embarrassment would be intolerable.
This guy probably doesn’t worry about such things, right?
Oh well.

[Don’t be careless, okay?]

So I said, and ended the conversation with a shrug.
Shion was entranced, admiring her sword. Soon she would be allowed to rampage as she like! Such a smile appeared on her face.
Had she not been so ditzy, she’d be the cool Shion.
That girl, entranced with her sword, makes a really dangerous impression.
Let’s act like we hadn’t seen it, shall we. That’s the best thing for my mental health.
As expected from Hakurou, he was calm as usual.
Or should I say: as bright and clean as a stainless mirror, truly a dignified presence that comes from a skilled person.
However,

[No opponents to sink my teeth in…]

He murmured, but my ears didn’t not miss it.

Seriously, I wonder if all Ogre people were this overconfident?
They had lost once against the same opponent, so I’d think they would be more wary in this situation.
Such worries caused me to let out a sigh.
But..... that my worries were completely unnecessary, was proven almost immediately later.

2 hours later.

(Would now be acceptable?)

Confirming the battle formation, I received a telepathic message.

(What? Did you find something?)
(No, just a single Lizardman, is running in our direction)
(What? Do you understand why?)
(Yes, according to the information from the clones, the war has already begun in the marshes, although I had warned them not to act alone...)
(Oh, is the one who leading them the Lizardmen name Gabil? That guy that was pointlessly overconfident....)
(That is likely. What should I do regarding the lizardman?)

Fumu. The war had already begun. But has the outcome been decided yet?
Rather, maybe we made it in the nick of time. Need to confirm the state of battle from above.
Well, about the Lizadman…

(Let’s hear his story. Whether it was the decision of the Chief or not, we need to confirm their intentions.)
(As you will!)

I cut the connection.
So, it had begun. I thought that we could enjoy a long awaited break but the circumstances seem to dictate otherwise.
So addressing everyone,

[Listen! The break’s over. The war has begun
From now on I will command from above!
 You guys follow my command, prepare yourself for war!]

Hearing my words, everyone faces tighten.

[Understood. For honor and glory!]

Shion replies and Benimaru nods
Hakurou casually walks forward.
I sprout wings from my back. The wings open a hole in the clothes, but once the wings disappear, the hole would close.
At my pleasure the clothing would change its form. A truly convenient ability.

[It’s an order. I forbid you to die. This war is not a decisive battle. Make no mistake!]
                                           
Hearing my words,

[  [  [  Oooo~o~o~o~o !!!]  ]  ]

They let out a battle cry.
While nodding, I soar to the sky.

From above, I observe the battle.
What cannot be seen with naked eye alone is clearly visible with [Magic Perception].
Almost as if you were observing with a satellite far beyond the clouds.
The current situation was bad for the Lizardmen.
Clearly, the situation had degraded to where they could not do anything and were surrounded.
They somehow manage to hold the orcs back, which was caused, it seems, by the desperate encouragements from their commander. However, they clearly wouldn’t last much longer.
That commander looks familiar. It’s Gabil. I had thought that he was just a fool, but it seems I had underestimated him.
For a commander, it is fatal to not be able to see the bigger picture.
However, no one would expect a young commander who lacks experience to properly observe the entire theatre.
In any age and in any country, not every commander is an excellent one.
Should he, however, survive and learn from this experience, he just might become an excellent one.
It’s pity for him to die here. So I thought. then issued orders.

(Benimaru, hear my wish. First, the encircled Lizardmen. Help them!
After that, do as you like. The details you will hear from Hakurou)

Replying happily to my orders.

(Understood! Is it okay if I go there with Ranga?)
(I leave it to you!)

Thus, I have begun to change the tides of war.
In fact, above the clouds, thinking while observing the armies clash and being able to understand their every movement, gives me a sense of overwhelming superiority.
I must also note that through “Thought Transmission”, the aerial information can be transmitted to every soldier.....
Information tactics of modern warfare can be implemented in a fantasy world..
Unlike conventional armies, the amount of information provided is vastly different. With this, it is be possible even for an individual unit to maneuver well.
Actually, this makes individual movement possible.
When I was thus thinking, Souei called.

(Rimuru-sama, apparently their flank was taken. The Chief’s son, Gabil had caused a rebellion.
Furthermore, the Chief was confined in an underground chamber.
They have also been attacked by the orcs, and anxiety spreads among their forces.)

I see, so he was his son. Moreover, we shouldn’t let anything happen to the Chief
Thus I had an idea,

(Souei, can you leap to the former Chief with shadow step?)

So I ask him, since they met once, it should be possible.....

(It’s possible, shall I go now?)
(I leave it to you. Assist the Chief, and do with the orcs in the caves as you please!)
(I will! ・・・・・・Would you have another minute?)

Shadow step, let’s practice that when the war ends. As I was thinking so, Souei called out.
Seems like he had more to say.

(What? Is there something else?)
(Ay! The clones have reported suspicious monsters in every direction across the marshes…
They have decent magical power, high ranking individuals. How should I proceed?]

What?
Could it be a trap? Even so, what kind of trap I—we wouldn’t know.

(How many have you confirmed?)
(Yes! I able to confirm, 4 individuals. Unfortunately, there could be more. However, I don’t feel any other auras.)
(I see...... Is it possible to dispose of them?)
(If doing it simultaneously, it may be possible with 2 clones… It may take time, but I can eliminate all of them!)

Truly an outstanding guy.
Somehow, I feel it’s best to dispose of them simultaneously.... Just what are they—that much is unclear.
But, would killing them be bad? I don’t know whether they are an enemy or not....

(Two clones at the same time, is it possible to neutralize them without killing?)
(Absolutely, it is possible)
(Send me the information about their position. I will send Shion and Hakurou)
(In that case, please have them contact me, we will neutralize the targets together.)
(I entrust it to you)

I told Shion and Hakurou about the situation.
Absolutely no killing, just knock them out! I ordered.
I don’t know who they are, and I don’t have any high class demon acquaintances.
Since they stand in every direction, they are either scouts or setting traps. They seem to haven’t noticed us, and are clearly not part of the Lizardmen’s fighting strength.
But this is too late for reconnaissance…so are they from the Orc army?
That also seems doubtful. Pointless, in my opinion.
A third party? Suddenly, I thought that.
Perhaps there are beings who are confirming the situation as we are.
Well, if they are successfully captured, I will ask them then. I don’t know if I can make them talk, but we’ll cross that bridge when we get there.
It’s unlikely that the demons came by the humans’ orders, since they are rather antagonistic.
Since thinking about it wouldn’t help, I decided to stop.
I issued orders and observed the situation.
Lizardmen side had begun to succumb to pressure.
They will surely fall soon. For all I know, the Chief was meeting a similar fate in the caverns.
Souei already dispatched his clones, but I wonder if his main body is unaffected?
My head as filled with many worries  at this late hour.
I issued an order, they followed it.
Someone was incompetent if he takes more that he can do.
Once, when I was still a rookie in the company, the Chief often got mad at me and said. Do not take more work than you can manage yourself!
When the person in question stagnates, everyone will be affected.
Since then, I avoided reckless action, always taking on only as much work as I knew I could handle.
This time, the gifted one can’t understand. They wouldn’t know whether the job I gave them was possible.
I pray that they are not incompetent. And, that they do not call me an incompetent lord.
For now, I think I’ll just continue to observe the situation.
If they face trouble, I will immediately send help

Well,
After finishing the telepathy, Souei wears a thin smile.
He feels he was able to help his Lord.
For Souei, Benimaru who is son of the lord was not his Lord.
Similar of age, Souei treats him as a rival. Someday, he considered to serve under him, but it was not meant to be.
Instead, they began to serve a lord named Rimuru.
I am fortunate, he thought.
A time of peace had continued for a while. Symbolizing strength, the Ogres had no opponent in the forest.
Recently, even lesser dragons had not caused any commotions.
He had thought that the peace was a good thing. However, they also wanted to use the skills they have obtained, such was their earnest wish.
Then, they were attacked by the Orc army.
He could do nothing at all, and left without avenging his lord and fallen comrades...
I am fortunate, he thought.
Under the new Lord, he was given the opportunity to avenge his former lord.
Negligence born of pride. That he currently did not have.
For the Lord, he had polished his technique (skill), all to eliminate his enemies.
Being commanded filled him with the highest of pleasure.
Souei calmly creates two clones of himself.
And,

(I will catch the two presences. Hakurou and Shion, go to south and west)

Confirming using telepathy, they acknowledged his request.
Each of the clones went to the north and east.
He himself sunk into shadows and disappeared. He was going to meet up with the Lizardmen’s Chief.
The high class demons were not his enemies right now.
He understands that much.

After receiving Souei request, Hakurou and Shion exchanged glances.
They nodded.

[So, I guess I’m off west.]
[Very well, I am going south]

After a short conversation, they run off.
They disappear from the spot with high speed.
Seeing their departure,

[Can’t be the last ones to leave!]

The main force led by Benimaru began to move.
Soundlessly like the wind, the Storm fanged wolves gallop into battle.
The goblins ride in enthusiasm.
They move in accordance to Rimuru’s order. So extreme was their joy, that they felt their very blood dance in delight.
You guys felt the same right.......
Benimaru thought so, he was aware of his carefree personality.
That’s why, he remember the hesitation he felt when faced with the need to take over the Ogre tribe village Chief. Right now, however, he had no such choice.
Thus, He liked his current position with Rimuru as the Lord he served.
As one of the military commander, he merely wished to rampage to his heart’s content.
Had he become Chief, he could not ride off to battle thus. But now was different.
He can participate without any concern.
Benimaru sprints.
He can’t stop his blood from boiling.


　−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−



Souei, Hakurou, Shion, had confirmed that they had arrived at their destinations.
To prevent their presence from being noticed, they concealed themselves.
In front of each of them, a suspicious demon was visible.
They confirmed their observations, and found their opinions to match.
This demon was a familiar of a High Devil which specialized in reconnaissance!
Just in case, Souei conveyed to the two

(I’m going to report this to Rimuru-sama)

Our lord would surely be troubled if suddenly beset by three reports.
The two reluctantly agreed, as the one who with the best telepathy was Souei.
Clumsy Shion was only good at receiving. She swore in heart to continue practicing.
After receiving the two’s permission,

(Rimuru-sama, the presence of demons was confirmed. It is familiar of a High Devil, which specialized in reconnaissance, are you sure you want to capture them?
In my opinion, that we killed them will not be discovered, so there is no cause for further concern!)

To Rimuru, he sent such a message with telepathy.
I leave it to you! So was the response.
With the other two discussing the timing, they decided to simultaneously eliminate the four scouts.

Hakurou would signal.
At the same time as Hakurou commands,

His slash gleaming, the monster before Hakurou is cut down and disappears.
As if sucked into the shadows, as if consumed by the ground… two more demons are crushed. Souei’s kills.
After one thunderous slash, the demon was blown away without a trace.... Shion’s target.

All happened within the same second.


The slash that Shion had put all her strength into, after blowing the demon away, lost none of its momentum and continued onward.
So great was the momentum, that it had reached the outskirts of the marshes and cut down many orcs.
And that attack signaled Rimuru’s participation in battle. 
',0,'2019-05-01 23:00:01.000000');
INSERT INTO `chapter`(`book_id`,`name`,`data`,`number_of_read`,`upload_date`) VALUES(7,'chapter 7',' A wide conference room.
The room were shrouded in silence.
Several shadows of men and women were sitting surrounding the large round meeting table.
A large crystal sphere was nested in the middle of the table.
From the lowest position seat near the entrance of the room, a man was casting some kind of spell towards the sphere.
The man dressed as a clown. His name is Gelmudo
He is the one who was entrusted with this meeting, and also the person responsible for certain project.
The project that he had worked for many years, and that project is to give birth to a new Demon Lord
For the sake of his own ambition, the project must not ended in failure.
And then, it was finally the last day of the project.
He succeeded in inviting the four whimsical “Demon Lord”
It has to succeed at all cost.
It’s impossible to make the Demon Lord move with money
You would need things that attract their interest, like a prey or a hard to obtain Magic Tool (Artifacts).
Anyway, it was necessary to pay a very valuable compensation.
This time, Gelmudo succeed in making the four Demon Lord move. In other words, the compensation he paid was enough.
When the time comes for the birth of a new Demon Lord, the other Demon Lord would not stay silent.
If a fool freely calling himself a Demon Lord, he or she would be killed because they invoked the Demon Lord’s wrath.Moreover, if there was such person that managed to turn the table against an infuriated Demon Lord.
Such person, if they had the ability,they would be recognized as a Demon Lord.             
These past several hundred of years. There was no birth of Demon Lord with such ability.
The last born Demon Lord, the Human “Demon Lord” Leon Cromwell.
With his overwhelming Magical power he increased the number of Majin (Demonic person) that he controlled, he claimed himself as the Demon Lord of the frontier.
One of the Demon Lord, which was furious with him, the Magic King (Curse Lord) had waged war against him. But he was slain by Leon instead.
He was also defeated by Leon’s own hands.
In response to the situation, the other Demon Lord recognized him as a new Demon Lord.
But, Demon Lord with such ability was not a common occurrence.
Therefore to claim a stranger as a Demon Lord, it was necessary to get the support of at least three or more Demon Lord. If you messed with the new Demon Lord, the supporting Demon Lord will become opponents at the same time, that is what to be expected.
And following such procedures,for the sake of the birth of the new Demon Lord, Gelmudo become fired up because of his ambition.

This time, to make the Orc Lord as Demon Lord would require one more step.
For the bored Demon Lord, he prepares the stage for the birth of the Demon Lord as a spectacle. It was for them to have fun, which was one of the conditions for the support.
Of course it’s not just that, he would also gave them Magic equipment (Magic Item) and Magic tool (Artifacts).
For Gelmudo this was a gamble of a lifetime.
The Orc Lord had to eat the Goblins and Lizardmen, to evolve as Demon Lord.
Today was the day when it will all end.
To become a Demon Lord and getting the support at the same time, one must devastated human city.
In doing so, it will become the news of the birth of a new Demon Lord.
If such things happened, Gelmudo’s ambition will be achieved. With manipulating the Orc Lord from the shadow, he would be on equal standing with the other Demon Lords.
And yet....

There was no reaction from the crystal ball.
Gelmudo become impatient.
This is bad.
He doesn’t want to imagine what happened if he offends the Demon Lord that were looking forward to the play.
It won’t projecting!   There’s nothing that can be done. At that moment, he wondered if he is going to become a minced meat.
Even, if he’s not killed, He might be cursed to become minced meat with only consciousness left.

It’s no use. I don’t want to imagine it anymore.
Gelmudo hurriedly cast the spell again, but there are still no reaction from the crystal ball. (TL: because his familiar was killed by Souei and co.)

[Hey...., what are you doing?]

A voice colder than ice echoes.
The room turns silent, the intimidation was enough to disturb Gelmudo’s spell.
Gelmudo was panicking with sweat leaking all over.

[Ple, Please wait! I will determine the cause right away!]

His instinct was saying, if he left it just like this it would be bad.
However,

Creak!

A sound of something that were creaking as if it was being squashed was heard. But no sooner than that,　

Baaaaa~~m !

On the right side of Gelmudo something big flew past by at high speed, it crashed at the rear door with thunderous sound.
One of the Demon Lord, a petite and beautiful silver haired girl, lifted and threw the big round table with her left hand.
It was without any skill.
The desk alone was several percent of state budget of a small country; it was a product of art from carved fragrant wood.
The heavy door in the back was decorated with elaborate decoration, Now it’s just a large hole in the building’s wall.
You can see it miserably destroyed, such thing happened.

[You...., are you treating me like a fool?]

The girl said.
Gelmudo cannot mutter his words well due to his fear.

[P, p, please forgive me!!! I will immediately confirm the cause myself!!!]

So he spoke.

[Really? Then made it quick. Since I’m generous, I’m going to wait!]

Which part of you are generous! Though he can’t even afford the time to think about it. 
Gelmudo was trembling in fear, the door was destroyed by the table that flew outside from the now large hole in the wall.
The conference room was on the 3rd floor, but he can’t be picky about appearances anymore.
He leaps outside and starts chanting flight movement spell.
His ambition has all scattered away.
What occupied Gelmudo’s thoughts now, he doesn’t want to die, only that.
He was not making fun of the Demon Lord. It’s the truth
But, it had been seen as if he was making fun of them.
Gelmudo prided himself as being a high ranked devil. That’s why; he thought he was able to put a good fight against one Demon Lord.
But because there was four here, he worried that it was necessary to depreciate oneself and praise the listener, so he thought.
That’s wrong.
Demon Lord is Demon Lord, because of that they were feared. Because he afraid of them, he was not a Demon Lord.
He knows it, he was being too conceited.
To become equal with the Demon Lord, such thing like that were impossible for Gelmudo.
He was able to truly understand it.
Those who can’t fathom the Demon Lord, won’t be able to speak with Demon Lord.

With speed reaching the speed of sound, Gelmudo flew toward the marshes.
But it was not for sake of his ambition.
But for his survival, he needs to fix the blunder with all his might.



　−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−





What the… What the hell is going on here?
While flying in the sky, I confirmed the situation of the war on the marshes.
A situation that I can’t understand, had happened in front of my eyes



What the hell is happening here!?
Like I’m gonna have any idea!!!

To my own question, I retort it myself.
I wish you can see it.
If seen from the above, a sudden flash was flashing from the corner, the bodies of the Orc soldiers were blown away along with a thunderous roar.
Hmm? When I observed at a certain direction… So Loud! A thunderous sound resounded.
Looking at it, there is a black sphere (Dome) appeared on the battlefield.
It disappears after a few seconds, leaving only the scorched ground.
The Orc soldiers that crowded that place had all been neatly erased.           

What the h.....!!!?

I was able to understand the situation in that moment, but I feel my heart refused to admit it.
Not just that, a raging storm appeared suddenly in one corner of the battlefield.
Numerous thunders from the storm struck the Orc soldiers killing and grilled them all. 
The orc soldiers clad in black armor on that corner;
Without any resistance they all turn into cinders by the power of the storm.
What the hell is going on? It was his honest thoughts.

With only a sword slash attack, Shion has mowed down many Orc soldiers.
The blade of the massive Odachi was emitting lilac lights. It’s wrapped in an aura.
Every time she swung her sword, flash of purple ran through, slashing and mowing down the Orc soldiers.
Of course, if someone received the direct attack of the blade they would not able to withstand it and be slashed into two.
The range of the blow was about 10 m. An attack that kill all in a straight line.
The graceful beauty, sprouting a slight smile, dancing around slashing all.
With bottomless stamina, she attack without any interruptions, all the Orc soldiers around her cannot come close.
It’s was an overwhelming strength.

But however, there are some guys that overshadowing Shion.
It was Benimaru and Ranga.
First Benimaru, what the hell kind of joke was that previous black sphere (Dome)?
No, I was able to vaguely understand the mechanism after I saw it for a moment.
In other words, It was a composite skill of [Barrier] [Fire Manipulation] [Black Lightning] I have.
First, the space is secured with [Barrier], He accelerate the molecular motion inside with [Fire Manipulation]. So it will produce a high temperature.
Finally, the magical power inside the space acts as fuel, and the [Black Lighting] will turn it into Plasma that would burn whatever is inside it.
It can be said that the skills had become the composite skill [Black Flame Manipulation].
I wonder if a degenerated version of the Unique skill [Shapeshifter] was passed down to Benimaru.
Because I had [Great Sage] there won’t be any mistake on its judgment.
That skill, unlike a nuclear explosion, its characteristic was not causing any damage outside of its radius.
The proof was, even if the boundary is released, there was no shock wave that went outside.
Range specification can be performed, it seems the purpose for increasing the inside heat synergistic-ally was to make the heat inside unbearable. So once confined inside the boundary, there will be no hope for survival.
The problem was, I don’t feel I want to freely use that kind of extremely dangerous skill.

And, one person or one animal.
It was Ranga.
I was surprised by this guy when he suddenly evolved into Black Storm Star Wolf (Tempest Star Wolf).....
The skill he use immediately after evolving was something to be astonished.
Evidently, if you used the [Black Lighting] without any imposing restrictions, the result will be AAAH.
It seemed what used just now was the strongest output, it seems like he can’t use it twice.
I was surprised that it had devastated the enemy forces on that corner with just one shot.

I can unconsciously or consciously put brake in my mind, but those guys weren’t like that.
Because It’s dangerous don’t use it, they didn’t have such thoughts.
The opponents will not hesitate to use such thing. It was the law of the jungle in this world, it was the natural course of action.
Maybe the strange one was me.
I was hesitating to use it, because I don’t want any allies to get any injuries.
Living in that world, there was an unspoken rule that powerful weapons cannot be used.
There was no meaning for weapons to only be used as deterrent. But, was it really just that?
It doesn’t make sense to spent money on weapons that can’t be used. So, how can money be spent for the development of weapons?
Was it going to be used when things going hairy?
At the very least, if it was used by a civilian it will be considered evil, then is it considered justice if it’s used on the battlefield?
On the other side, using weapon to kill was not counted as a crime.
And thus… To hold a power that can be used as a deterrent, perhaps showing off a power that used to coerce them, are not a mistake.



Since the fighting began, two hours has passed.
Benimaru shoot off another four black spheres (dome) shaped attack.
As I expected it can’t be fire rapidly, but it seems it didn’t require a large amount of Magic power (Energy).
Ranga only shoot on the first attack.
I thought the power was too high.Still, it was an AoE attack.
Thus, with just that single attack, it seems to have made the opponents recognized the feeling of fear.
All the Orc soldiers that were trying to escape were eviscerated by Shion.
I renew how I felt, and calmly mobilize the battle progress
It’s strange, my feelings were calm.
The first blow was dealt by Benimaru, but the rest of the attack point was on my commands.
It was aimed at the crowed areas, to cut down the enemy’s forces.
Shion was successful in finishing off her enemy, she continued to strike the place as ordered.
Hakurou was taking care of the enemy’s commander, he precisely kill the general class.
It can’t be called a battle. Approaching without any sound, and in an instant he cut them all down.
Because the effect of the Unique skill [Starving ones] is to increase the power of an individual under its influence after devouring corpse. So, it was a good idea to destroy the corpse of the one that was cut down.
Is it some kind of Hakkei (Internal power emission)? A ghastly aura was released from the palm and it cremates the corpse.
Rather than cremating,its closer to the image of being dissolved...
I locate where the Orc general was and they were instantaneously killed by Hakurou after I communicated with him.
The current situation, the losses of the Orc soldiers reached about 30%.
And then, the Orc Lord finally began to show movement.




Once the time to reorganize the forces of both sides comes, they shifted from confrontation to glaring at each other.
The free me, was calmly observing the situation. 
The pigs were tense after they noticed the superiority they brought here was lost.
The Orc Lord comes out to the front.
A monstrous and ugly pig.
Suddenly, the two surviving Orc Generals were cut from head to toe and devoured.
The dull yellow colored eyes were filled with hostility, and he releases his aura.
In response to the aura, all of the orc soldier’s forces seemed to brimming with power...

(Benimaru, can you cast Black Flame Prison (Hell Flare) again?)
(It’s an easy victory if I cast them!)

(Ranga, how about you?)
(My Lord! About thirty percent of my magic power has recovered. It won’t bring out power like the previous one, but it’s possible to shot it one more time!)
(One shot is enough. Beside, that strike at the Orc was an overkill. Just half of the power was enough to kill them.
Cast it with the same range as earlier, but decrease the power when use it!)
(With pleasure!)

(Shion. This time I want you to strike the Orc Lord with a flashy single slash!)
(Yes! I will use all of my power this time!)
What...? Up until now she didn’t use her full power!? Well....
(O, ou! Do your best!)
She was brandishing her Odachi joyfully with full power, or trying to slashing with it.
This fellow might be holding a strange strength after all, or so I thought.

(Hakurou. You also want to kill the Orc Lord? But not this time. Please endure!)
(Whew, understood. You want the young people to blossom....)
(I’ll be counting on you!)



This way, I finish the preparation for the interception.
The Orc Lord was no longer a threat.
That fellow ability was still uncompleted. I offer him my prayers. At the time I was thinking that

Kiin!!!



A harsh sound was heard.
My [Magic Perception] had perceived someone that comes flying at supersonic speed from a distance.
That person was in the middle of the marshes, and landed in the middle of the two confronting armies.
I feel a pretty strong aura from the strange men that dressed like a clown
Perhaps, it was a high ranked Devil.
I followed after him, and then I landed on the ground.
At that moment, both Ranga and Benimuru come next to my side
The man that looked like a clown glanced at me.



[What the heck is all of this!? To dare to ruin this Gelmudo-sama plan like this!!!]

So he shouted loudly.
Gelmudo. The high ranked Devil, the mastermind of this war.

And the first Devil I met in this world.

INSERT INTO `chapter`(`book_id`,`name`,`data`,`number_of_read`,`upload_date`) VALUES(7,'chapter 8',' The Chief of the Lizardmen had desperately tried to hold back the incoming attack from the orc soldiers.
He divided the troops and sends them forth to the 4 passageway, they will be supporting each other.
Since the passageway was not really that large, and the fact that only a few can fight, it was a relief.
If you considered the strength of the individuals, the small forces of Lizardmen had higher strength compared the Orc soldiers.
At the end of the chamber are the evacuated women and children, and those who can fight are protecting them in the front lines.
They were there in case that someone managed to break through from the passage.
The Chief observed the war situation and realized that they could not survive more than a day.
While he kept switching the troops to let them recover their fatigue, they are still managing to fight decently, even so, between the gap of switching the two teams, they were pushed back little by little.
Their current forces was less than 1,200.
Even without regrouping, he can see that there were some of the troops that died in battle.
Also, another nightmare struck the Chief. The Orc soldiers began to be shrouded in yellow aura.
What is this?
Was what he thought, but the answer was given immediately. The combat ability of the individual orc was increasing.
While they did not drastically grow stronger, they now posed the ability to win against a Lizardmen.
Until now, the individual ability of Lizardmen was able to hold them off, but now that advantage was lost.

This is it...The only fate remaining for them is a honorable death.
The Chief prepared his resolution.
Escaping would be useless, struggling any longer would be useless.
Even so.....

[ Listen!!! Women and children shall retreat from this place! Guards, Gather!
You guys shall escorts the women and children, keep protecting them to the very end, even if it’s just 1 more person! I will not tolerate anyone who gave up! To obtain the new world (Alt: or to see the future), as many people as possible are needed to survive!!! ]

With all of the dignity he had, he spoke in a loud voice.

[Chief, are you going to do it?]

The Vice captain of the Guards come asking.

[ I know! I won’t let the Orc do as they pleased!
   I will show them the strength of Lizardmen !!! ]


Never show your weaknesses.
For him, it was the symbol of strength for the Lizardmens which bring him hope.

[Warriors! Prepare yourself to fight to the death against the Orc! Do not let a single one of them pass!
We will buy the woman and children the time they needed to escape!!! ]


And so, the warriors group becomes inspired.
There was no despair in the Lizardmen faces. Even if the opponent was stronger, if it possible for the women and children to escape, it’s their victory.
Their future will not cease.
After this, it would be a difficult time for them, but that doesn’t mean the end of their species.


[ [  [U~o o ooooo ! ! ! ]  ]  ]


They raise their voice to dispel their fear.
The cave interior was filled with the Lizardmen war cry and it reverberate with thunderous vibration.
Satisfied with the situation, a voice heard from the place where the women and children tried to escape. 

[ That’s going to be troubling. Chief-dono, the promise was still not fulfilled yet. Weren’t you supposed to wait here?]

Quietly, there stood a man which nobody unawares of.
With darkish skin, bluish black hair. Blue eyes, a demon with height 190 cm.
Once, he and the demon had met, which he identified himself as Souei.
Have they arrived? No, the alliance was not formed yet. But....


[ Souei-dono...  Have they arrived? But, we did not follow your advice, we have been disrespectful…]
[ Advice...?  What you talking about?  Such thing does not matter at all. All of you please stay in this place. The promise is tomorrow. Tomorrow, My Lord wish to come here personally.]

The promise for alliance, he doesn’t know if it can protect them. But...

[However, we cannot stay here, the Orcs are here!]

Hearing the words, Souei glanced at the passages with the noisy Orc soldiers.
He look at them as if he was looking at trash.


[Those guys noisy stomach certainly can’t calm down.... Very well. I suppose I have to clean them up first. Please wait here for a moment.]

After he said that, he started to calmly walk towards them.
Is it illusion? It’s looks as if Souei body start blurring and overlapping.....No! It has divided into four clones.
Each of them went into the passage, they reached the place where the Lizardmen were devoting themselves to defense.

[Substitute] 

Saying that word.
The 4 clones in each passage were facing the Orc soldiers.
Then the Lizardmen that were there saw the incredible spectacle.
The orcs, who have tormenting us as if hungry ghosts from hell, could not break through Souei’s stoic defense.
At each passage stand a single person.

[Misaitoayazanjin! (Beheading Formation of Restraining String!) ]
It was a slaughter dance of glittering string.
Steel thread spreading around the passage instantly, and it move freely according to Souei‘s command.
As soon as he executes the technique in the passage, the Orc soldier’s body was cut down.
For those who come to invade, they think it will be a massacre without any resistance.
It was unfortunate for those Orc soldiers. At each and every passage, every one of them got killed by the skill that Souei’s clones used.
Without their sense of self, only following simple order, therefore they cannot feel fear.
One by one, they march forward as if to let themselves be trapped in the stretched spider thread.  However, this thread is terrible trap that instantly reap life itself.
They happily devoured the corpse that has been chopped to pieces, continuing their advance, and get killed.
The scene repeated endlessly, the Lizardman can’t let out any sounds.
The battlefield with structure like labyrinth is a stage for Souei.
The spread sharp trap had many varieties; he can change it according to the situation. This time, Souei focused his interest in elimination of the Orc soldiers.
He didn’t show any mercy, he carry out the slaughter without even batting an eyelids.
The Lizarmen didn’t let any sound in astonishment.
After witnessing the strength from a different dimension. It’s become the embodiment of fear.
Overwhelming and surpassing them all, it was the figure of the strong.

The situation has changed; 2 hours has passed since then.
Until now, the Orc soldiers that had come to invade were easily killed and they suddenly begun to withdraw.
Has something occurred that it changed the war situation?
Souei intuitively think.
The amount of clones that he can use at the same time is 6. Because the first two clones went out, only four clones left to protect the chamber.
The main body was lurking in the shadow while controlling the clones.
Everything is all right now. He decides to entrust the rest to his clones.
Souei’s main body begun to move without anyone noticing.
He returned back to his Lord’s side, Rimuru.



　−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−




The Demon Lord Orc Disaster had identifies himself as a Demon Lord. Moreover, the name was someone else’s. Or in this case, it would be correct if I say that hestole it?
The Demon Lord Orc Disaster fulfilled Gelmudo’s ambition to become a Demon Lord, but it just that.
The one who really desire to become Demon Lord was Gelmudo.
The Orc Lord without self-awareness wasloyal to him. Of course, I was not aware of such thing, it don’t have any relation with them.
Self-awareness begun to appear, his eyes become intelligent.
Declaring himself the Demon Lord, as the Demon Lord Orc Disaster Gelmudo, he has evolved with strength beyond comparison of an Orc Lord.

Behind me, Benimaru was in a battle stance.
He probably recognized the Demon Lord Orc Disaster Gelmudo as a threat.
The smile he showed up until now had disappeared, it has become a serious expression.
　
[Rimuru-sama! I will handle it!]

So he says, he used the Black Flame Prison (Hellflare).
I receive the signal by telepathy; I proceed to fly into the sky. It’s good to have the wings.
The Demon Lord Orc Disaster Gelmudo is in the center of the formed black sphere (dome). Inside it raged a high temperature storm that burn the Demon Lord. However....
After about ten seconds, the Demon Lord Orc Disaster calmly stands in the location of the disappeared sphere (Dome).
It’s not that it doesn’t effective. He doesn’t seem to have any heat resistance ability, his skin is completely burnt.
But it’s not a mortal wound, because he clad himself in his aura, it seems to had similar effect with Heat resistance (resist).
Moreover, the burnt skins are starting to regenerate.It’s the same as Gelmudo, he also had regeneration ability.
The magical energy is now overwhelmingly different from just. Heis now a self-proclaimed Demon Lord.
Rather, “Voice of the World” said it before; this guy had the “Demon Lord Quality”. He evolved, and truly become a Demon Lord.
This guy must be killed now, or he will become a real disaster. I’m convinced so.
Benimaru is frowning, because it managed to withstand his deadly attack.
Indeed, Black Flame Prison (Hellflare) is powerful. However, it is an AoE skill that weak if used against an individual.
The energy is scattered and not focused. To use it against an individual, more of the energy has to be focused.
If done that way, the resistance and the regeneration will not able to cope and he will be completely burned.


The one who attack next after Benimaru was Ranga.
He use the [Black Lighting] just like I suggest him to and converge it to a single point before shooting it.
Receiving a direct hit, the Demon Lord Orc Disaster Gelmudo body stiffened.
The aim is good; I will use it that way from now on.
The area of attack was adjusted for individual target, the optimum blow.
The black charred Demon Lord Orc Disaster, collapse in the place where he stands.
Of course that happens. Even I could not bear such attack.
Rather than one on one it’s a fight against many opponent, moreover defeatedby a surprise attack, please do not think badly of me.
Perhaps, any of the Oni would not win in one on one.
But, with this the war would finally end....... at the very moment I think that,


[Fuha~a! So this is pain! I even sawa glimpse of death!
But, it not enough to make the great me perish!!!]

Even though he is carbonized and seemed dead, the Demon Lord Orc Disaster rises up.
If you look at him, he pulls and torn his arm and eats it.
The Demon Lord Orc Disaster then ran to the Orc soldiers. He casually kills the Orc soldiers and eats them.
What a guy! Each time he eat, his carbonized skin peel off and a brand new skin appear.
Also, the arm that he torn off has regrown
Really, what a tremendous regeneration ability.


[Are you kidding me...]


Ranga murmured involuntary.
It goes beyond aridiculous monster, its way beyond reality.
It seems Ranga’s energy was empty after using that attack. He sat down and stops moving.
I wonder if he is entering the low activity state.
It can’t be helped. Energy consumption of [Black Lighting] was enormous.
With this, he will not able to use it any more.

A single flash.
Unnoticed, Shion swung her Ōdachi, she did a single slash.
The slash that she had put all her strength into. The Demon Lord Orc Disaster stops the slash with the Butcher knife “Meat Crusher” in his hand.
The slash didn’t connect. He takes some damage from the blow. But it’s not serious.

[This filthy pig is a Demon Lord? Stop being so conceited!]


She shout, and once again she clad her Ōdachi with her aura, she raise her sword over her head and then swings it down.
The Demon Lord Orc Disaster stood to his feet while staggering, this time he hold the Butcher knife “Meat Crusher” with both hands. The sword and the knife clash, resulting in fierce sparks.
The Demon Lord Orc Disaster won the pushing contest. His physical strength surpassed even Shion\'s, the one who has ridiculous strength and [Herculean Strength].
It seems his physical abilities is strengthened to an overwhelming level...., I heave a sigh at that.
Shion was sent flying, The Demon Lord Orc Disaster try to finished Shion off.
Perceiving the danger, Shion covered her body with her aura.
But it seems she receive considerable damage from that attack.
Her face filled with frustration, it seem it will take some time until she is able to move again.


Without noise, standing behind the Demon Lord Orc Disaster is a person, a samurai in his prime.
Hakurou.
Even I, observing from the sky can recognize the speed of the slash, it will hit.
It can’t be stopped, it’s also impossible to avoid it. The sword slashes through the body of Demon Lord Orc Disaster, cutting him into 2 separate pieces, the head fall. 
With this he should be dead. So I thought.
Yet....
The separated body parts connected by a yellow aura that coiling into them like a tentacles
Then it bend down, picking up the head that fell down, and fixed the head back to the original location. 
It looks like a sight from a horror movie, everyone lost their words.
Hakurou also opened his eyes in surprise.
I’m convinced now.
The Demon Lord Orc Disaster most formidable ability is his tremendous regeneration ability.
Up until now, it doesn’t have variety of resistance. However the problem is his recovery power. Also, added with his resistance, it would be impossible to kill him.
However, if we burn him together with Flame and [Black Lighting], it’s possible to surpass his defense and restoration ability.
But now it’s impossible......

Benimaru and Ranga have run out of Magic power. Shion is injured, right now Hakurou is exchanging blade against him one on one.
Hakurou’s attack did not hit its target, the Demon Lord Orc Disaster’s attack also doesn’t hit.
As expected from a master. However, how long will it continue, the situation is gradually getting worse.

At that time,

[ Beheading Formation of Restraining String!  ]


At the same time as the voice heard, the Demon Lord Orc Disaster is captured by the “Sticky Steel Thread”.
It was Souei‘s doing. Quietly, lurking in Hakurou’s shadow, he is waiting for the right timing.
I see! I was impressed.
Like this, even if you have high regeneration ability it would be useless.
Hero always comes late. As expected of Souei.
The moment I feel relived, I sense something out place.
His yellow aura is coiling around the “Sticky Steel Thread”.　


[Chaos Eater]

The Demon Lord Orc Disaster uses his skill. It is more heinous than when he uses it at the Orc General.
It corrodes every thing it touches.
That yellow aura thingies must be the essence of the Demon Lord Orc Disaster skill.
In fact, that skill is one of the ability of the Unique skill [Starving Ones].
Its effect is corroding and decomposing every material he come in contact with.
When the resistance failed to resist the corrosion, death will visit the living creature.
The Demon Lord Orc Disaster begin his pursuit.

[Die! Gaki no kōshinenbu!!! (Death March Dance)

It was the skill that Gelmudo used. But, the power level is different.
Sensing it, Hakurou and Souei retreat.
Benimaru’s black flame prison (Hell Flare), nothing remains on its surrounding. Although it power is not absolute, it didn’t give damage to the person touching it, instead it will give them corrosion effect.
Quality, power, range. If all of it combined it will become a certain kill attack. Fortunately the speed is slow.
If they receive it normally, the Oni will not stay unharmed.
[Fuhah~a! Good! Entertain me more! It’s a good exercise before the meal.
You guys must be very delicious. Fuhahaha! You all will become food for me. You guys happy?]


My subordinate, the main force of five people even if they work together, they are still unable to win.
This is...

I’m no longer able to stop my body tremble.
This trembling is, a trembling that comes from my instinct.
This bad. I can’t stop trembling

Was it, fear?

No, it’s different

This was...

Joy.  Yes. I was feeling joyful!

I, from the bottom of my body, can no longer stop my instinct from going crazy and making noises from joy
My subordinate, the main force of five people fighting together were not able to win against this opponent.
Yet, in my mind there was no fear.
The feeling of depression that appear on the beginning, at this point it has all been blown away
That’s right, I recognize this guy as an enemy.
Sorry for thinking of you as troublesome.
I stop flying and descend to the ground.
When I come closer, the yellow aura, Chaos Eater rushed towards me.
I feel it coiling around me and stick to my body. This is unpleasant.
I see, so he trying to eat me?
Nice, if you think you can do it, then do it!
Feeling highly excited from my instinct, smile began to float on my face.
Before you eat me, I will eat you first!

And thus the time comes for the clash between me and the Demon Lord Orc Disaster Gelmudo.
