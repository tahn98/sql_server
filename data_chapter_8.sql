Even though it’s already the early summer, the snow has yet to melt. The cold here is exceptionally long. The roars of beasts can occasionally be heard.

On the surface of the valley stood a magnificent city.

The world outside of the St. Ancestral Mountains has been occupied by the beasts. The people living in the mountain range have not contacted the outside world for hundreds of years.

The people who live in the city are unsure of the situation of the outside world. It’s been recorded that at the most glorious period of mankind, having thousands of Legend rank Fighters and Demon Spiritualists, the humans established many empires in the vast continent, but those empires have been wiped out.

The city, due to being stealthily located geographically, was well preserved from the Age of Darkness. They would occasionally encounter attacks from powerful Snow Wind Beasts within the St. Ancestral Mountains, however, after going through numerous devastating conflicts, the city was be rebuilt again and again.

These motley walls were an indomitable monument.

This city is called Glory City, and it is a symbol of hope for humanity.

Holy Orchid Institute, Fighter Apprentice class

Over thirty students are sitting down and are awaiting to listen to the female teacher as she imparts her knowledge. The students are a bunch of Fighter Apprentices. They are Glory City’s Holy Orchid Institute’s students.

“I heard that the new teacher, Shen Xiu, is one of the Sacred Family’s 3-star Silver rank Demon Spiritualists!”

A few students were discussing softly among themselves.

The attention of the students was focused on the teacher. She had a tall figure, was wearing a lavender dress that wrapped tightly against her body, giving an emphasis of her perky chest. She had a pair of slender, white legs, and wore exquisite make-up that made her look beautiful and elegant. Her eyes were full of pride and arrogance. The Sacred Family is one of the three Major families of Glory City. Because she is of noble birth, and a 3-star Silver rank Demon Spiritualist, she naturally has the capital to be prideful.

As a 3-star Silver rank Demon Spiritualist, she wouldn’t normally come here to teach. She only agreed to because her nephew is in this class.

“Demon Spiritualists and Fighters have five different ranks, which are: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Black Gold and Legend rank. Each rank is then divided into five levels, from 1-star to 5-star.

“A Demon Spiritualist is above a Fighter. We are a truly noble existence. A Demon Spiritualist can form a soul realm within their dantian. They have the ability to integrate a captured demon into their soul realm and then merge with the demon in combat. This allows them to possess matchless strength, which is far above the strength Fighters could compete with.” Shen Xiu raised her chin and spoke arrogantly, “Just like me, my demon is a Scarlet Flame Fox.”

Suddenly, Shen Xiu’s face and hands underwent drastic changes. Her facial shape became sharper, her teeth and nails also became sharper. Finally, a scarlet tail emerged from her back.

“After merging with a demon, I can control its strength as well as gain fire-type abilities. Among the demons, the Scarlet Flame Fox is a Gold rank beast. This means that the highest level I can reach is Gold rank Demon Spiritualist. Of course, after becoming a Gold rank Demon Spiritualist, I can replace it with a more powerful demon.”

When it came to her cultivation, the pride on Shen Xiu’s face became thicker.

Shen Xiu’s words caused a group of students to be amazed. Gold rank Demon Spiritualists are existences beyond the reach for most of them.

As Shen Xiu continued lecturing on the stage, Nie Li was sitting in the back row. His mind was in a trance as his soul floated around.

After a while, Nie Li slowly opened his eyes. He couldn’t help being confused by the scene in front of him.

“Where am I?” Nie Li quietly asked himself.

He was utterly shocked as he realised that his hands became smaller and his skin became a lot more tender.

Shen Xiu was on the stage, talking nonstop. Nie Li clearly remembered that this was the year he joined the institute. The teacher lecturing was a 3-star Silver rank Demon Spiritualist and was extremely arrogant. Because of her, Nie Li was unwilling to learn for quite sometime.

“I was actually reborn?” Nie Li was deeply shocked. He remembered being surrounded and attacked by the Sage Emperor and six Deity rank beasts and died in the battle. It seems his soul was reborn to the time when he was thirteen years old.

Nie Li looked towards the side, and saw familiar faces: Lu Piao and Du Ze. These brothers that had shared life and death with him are alive, except their appearances were very immature.

And her, Nie Li looked towards the left. A few meters away from him, a beautiful flawless face came into his field of vision. Her name is Ye Ziyun. Although her appearance is only thirteen-fourteen years old, she already looked slender and elegant with purple coloured hair pouring down to her waist. She had arched eyebrows, and an intelligent radiance was seen within her eyes. Whenever she smiled, she would have deep dimples.

Although she looked a little childish, Nie Li knows that, when she grows up a bit more, she will be extremely beautiful and enchanting. She wore a silk white dress that  gave her a kind of unspeakable elegance. In his previous life, Nie Li had a deep affection for her ever since he was a teen.

‘She’s not dead!’

Nie Li was extremely excited to the point that he almost choked.

“I actually went back in time, is this real? Not a dream?” Nie Li asked himself as he severely pinched himself. The clear pain told him that this wasn’t a dream. Suddenly he thought of something.

“The Temporal Demon Spirit Book. It must’ve been the Temporal Demon Spirit Book!”

Nie Li lowered his head and immediately searched for it, but could not find the Temporal Demon Spirit Book.

Nie Li could not believe that his rebirth, this mysterious phenomenon that happened to him, was not related to the mysterious Temporal Demon Spirit Book!

That Temporal Demon Spirit Book’s creator was not known. It’s a highly mysterious book that Nie Li always kept with him. He clearly remembered, when he was fighting the Sage Emperor and the six Deity rank beasts, that his blood had thoroughly covered the book. It must have been the Temporal Demon Spirit Book that brought him back to when he was only thirteen.

After seeing all these familiar faces, Nie Li drifted into his distant memory.

He remembered when Glory City was under the assault of the Snow Wind beasts. Glory City’s guardian, Lord Ye Mo, who was a Legend rank Demon Spiritualist, died in the battle with the beasts among hundreds of thousands of people. Only a few thousand survived and fled to the desert, east of the St. Ancestral Mountain range. During the escape, one survivor after another died in the desert. One day, they were surrounded by the beasts in the desert. Later that night, Nie Li and Ye Ziyun sought the comfort of each other’s soul.

That night, Nie Li had finally embraced the goddess in his heart with his arms.

Under the night sky, the silver moonlight became a hazy veil. Ye Ziyun’s exquisite physique, with her crystal clear skin that looked as though she was molded from a jade sculpture. They embraced each other with a mad passion.

If it wasn’t for the destruction of Glory City, and for the dreadful escape, he could never have gotten the favor of Ye Ziyun. He had ridiculously low talent and was from a declining family.

After that night, they encountered another group of beasts and in order to protect him, Ye Ziyun died by the hands of one of the beasts. Nie Li could never forget that moment.

After he experienced the life threatening attacks, Nie Li survived and walked out of the Endless Desert.

Although his talent was low, his survival instincts allowed Nie Li to travel throughout the Divine Continent. He came across many people who were fighting the beasts. He also came across many mysterious things, and of course that Temporal Demon Spirit Book. If it wasn’t for the book, Nie Li wouldn’t have been able to come back.

That mysterious Temporal Demon Spirit Book, actually brought him back through time!

He was brought back to before Glory City’s destruction. Before his parents, family and brothers death in the battle. Before Ye Ziyun’s death in the escape.

“Since I’m back, the heavens have given me another chance. I will not let the destruction of Glory City happen again!” Nie Lie said under his breath, gritting his teeth. He firmly made his decision.

He vaguely remembers that he should have just enrolled into the institute this year and he should be thirteen years old. Nie Li wanted to laugh happily, ‘I’m back, how nice!’

‘Sage Emperor, the next time we meet, I’ll slaughter you, and avenge my previous life!’

If it wasn’t for the destruction of Glory City, him and Ye Ziyun would be from two different worlds. It wouldn’t be possible for them to be together. Ye Ziyun was the daughter of Glory City’s City Lord, not to mention that her grandfather is the Legend rank Demon Spiritualist Ye Mo. Nie Li was from a family who was powerless and was declining. Both of them, in the midst of escape, built up deep feelings for each other.

When Ye Ziyun entered the school, no one in class knew her identity. Nie Li only found out about her identity later.

Within Glory City, there are three Major families. The Divine Family, the Sacred Family, and the Snow Wind Family. They represented the supreme power of Glory City, the pinnacle of the noble families. The City Lord was usually chosen from one of these three families. After the three Major families were the seven Noble families and after them were the twelve Aristocratic families.

Nie Li belonged to the Heavenly Marks Family, which stood at last place of the Aristocratic families. Although they have a little status, there is an astronomical difference in status when compared to the three Major families and the seven Noble families.

With Nie Li’s background, wanting to be with Ye Ziyun was simply impossible.

But, with a firmness that flashed across Nie Li’s eyes, since he was reborn, is all this of still an issue? Although his foundation is currently poor, with the vast knowledge from his previous life, improving his talent isn’t impossible.

“Nie Li, what are you smiling at?” Lu Piao asked,  looking puzzled at Nie Li. He was wondering if he has crazy, since he was giggling by himself for quite sometime and was even staring at Ye Ziyun with a lecherous look.

“Just being happy! I’m happy to see you, good brother!” Nie Li stated as he excitedly hugged Lu Piao. It’s a habit from his previous life.

After being ridiculously hugged by Nie Li, Lu Piao muttered angrily, “Oi, Nie Li! Who’s your good brother, you gaylord?! Quickly, release me!”

Lu Piao struggled. They’ve just started school not long ago. They were only acquainted for only a few days. They were not close enough for this level of intimacy.

Nie Li didn’t loosen his hug. He looked at Lu Piao seriously and chuckled “No matter what you’re thinking, in my heart, you’re always my good brother!”

Naturally Nie Li couldn’t tell Lu Piao the life and death adventures from his previous life.

Looking at Nie Li’s gaze, Lu Piao was stunned and couldn’t help saying, “Weirdo!”

However, no matter what, the words Nie Li said previously, made him feel moved.

Lu Piao looked at Nie Lie and said, “I know you’re one of the nobility in Glory City, but let me warn you: Do not have any ideas for that girl. Her identity is extremely mysterious. I heard that when she joined the institute the principal personally arranged her dorm.

Nie Li slightly grinned, Lu Piao still doesn’t know Ye Ziyun’s identity which he already knew.

“She’s my woman!” Nie Li declared, looking at the beautiful long haired girl not far away. His heart was exceptionally firm as he thought of that night’s passion. Nie Li couldn’t help feeling hot in his heart.

Nie Li suddenly remembered, he and Ye Ziyun are still only thirteen!

‘Ziyun, when will you grow up to become that beautiful, enchanting woman? I shall protect you and we will grow up together!’

Not far away, Ye Ziyun felt something. She turned her head and looked towards Nie Li. She gently wrinkled her brows, and thought that Nie Li must be a playful noble. Since the start of class, he has been unrestrainedly looking at her. If he dares to provoke her, she’ll not let him off easy.

Ye Ziyun didn’t want to make use her status to make friends, but that doesn’t mean that she’ll submit to humiliation when being bullied.

INSERT INTO `chapter`(`book_id`,`name`,`data`,`number_of_read`,`upload_date`) VALUES(8,'chapter 2','Next to Ye Ziyun sat a tall and handsome boy who was, occasionally, catching a glimpse of Ye Ziyun. He noticed that Ye Ziyun was looking at Nie Li. He threw a furious look towards Nie Li. His height were slightly taller than Nie Li, and began emitting a faint yin aura.

Naturally, Nie Li recognized this person. He’s Shen Yue. He belongs to the Sacred Family, which is one of the three Major families and has extraordinary talent. Shen Xiu, who’s currently talking on the stage, is his aunt.

In Nie Li’s past life, Shen Yue had always been Ye Ziyun’s pursuer. Before Glory City was destroyed, Shen Yue and Ye Ziyun almost got married. In the eyes of their families, they had always been a perfect match. If Glory City wasn’t destroyed, both of them would have definitely gotten married. Before they underwent the marriage ceremony, Glory City was under the attack of the Snow Wind beasts. before the city was broken through by the beasts, the Sacred Family betrayed Glory City by abandoning their duties and fled.

This may be the work of fate. Ye Ziyun did not become Shen Yue’s wife in his previous life. Instead, she had some kinship activities with Nie Li.

Thinking back, Nie Li couldn’t help laughing in his heart. However, after he saw Ye Ziyun and Shen Yue’s glares, Niu Li couldn’t help feeling a headache forming. The current Ye Ziyun had a few good impressions of Shen Yue. The look that Ye Ziyun give to Nie Li was full of disdain. Ye Ziyun must have thought of him as a lazy, playful person.

When he saw Ye Ziyun look in his direction, Nie Li felt a lag in his breath. When he saw that familiar face, he began to think of everything that happened in his previous life. Nie Li couldn’t help feeling sour in his nose. He revealed a smile as he looked deeply at Ye Ziyun.

‘Many thanks to the Temporal Demon Spirit Book. It allowed us to meet once again.’ Nie Li silently thought with gratitude.

‘Weirdo,’ Ye Ziyun thought. She felt that Nie Li’s gaze was somewhat strange. His bright eyes shined like stars, with a touch of sadness. Ye Ziyun’s heart was filled with questions. Does she know Nie Li? Why does he look at her with that kind of gaze?

Ye Ziyun’s a beauty with white teeth and vermilion lips. She was like a lotus blooming silently, while having an unspeakable cute temperament. This was why there are so many boys fascinated with her.

At this point, Shen Xiu’s gaze swept passed Nie Li’s body. The action of these thirteen-fourteen year old kids couldn’t escape her eyes. She is a Silver rank Demon Spiritualist. She already reached the state of having the mind and body being one powerful sixth sense. Her eyesight was extremely keen. She could even see a fleeing rat over a hundred meters away.

Ye Ziyun has a noble identity. She has the status of being the daughter of Glory City’s City Lord, as well as being the granddaughter of the Legend rank Demon Spiritualist, Ye Mo. Not only that, she has a cyan soul realm formed within her dantian. A rare talent!

Only a few people in the Holy Orchid Institute know of Ye Ziyun’s identity. If Shen Yue manages to have Ye Ziyun as his wife, it could strongly strengthen the Sacred Family’s position in Glory City. This is also why he’s in the Fighter Apprentice class. It’s also another reason why Shen Xiu is teaching this class.

Shen Xiu reverted her transformation with both of her arms hugging her chest. her eyes swept across the students and said, “For the next two years, all of you are my students. Although the principal mentioned that Holy Orchid Institute’s students are equal, I have to let you know the ugly truth. In this world, equality doesn’t exist!” Shen Xiu spoke in a slightly shrill voice. Her words were like daggers that heavily stabbed into the hearts of the students.

The students below the stage were quietly listening. No one spoke a word.

“After you have all grown up and left this school, you will agree with my words. Equality is merely a lie that adults fill you with. You can’t be living in a fairy tale forever,” Shen Xiu said, lowering her head to look at the students. “Glory City is the only city that has been preserved throughout the Age of Darkness. We are the only surviving humans. Within Glory City there are two kinds of powerful existences.The Fighters and the Demon Spiritualists. A Demon Spiritualist’s existence is noble. Only one Fighter within thousands or tens of thousands could have a chance of being born a powerful Demon Spiritualist. Until now, in all of Glory City, only a few thousand Demon Spiritualists exist. We are the guardians of Glory City!”

“Fighters and Demon Spiritualists are divided into Bronze, Silver, Gold, Black Gold and Legend ranks. The higher the rank, the more powerful one is. If a family produces a Gold rank Demon Spiritualist, they can become an aristocratic family. If a family produced a Black Gold rank Demon Spiritualist, they can become a Noble family. If a family produces three Black Gold rank Demon Spiritualists or a Legend rank Demon Spiritualist, that family can become a Major family. We have thirty-six people here. Some come from commoner families, some come from noble families. Although your starting point is the same, your identities are not. I hope each and every one of you has self-awareness and a degree of manners. Commoners will always remain commoners. It’s impossible for you to become an Aristocratic family, so do not dream of rising up to become a phoenix. Even within nobility, they have a strict difference of levels that can never be exceeded.”

Under Shen Xiu’s gaze, the students that were simply dressed in the class showed discomfort on their faces. They were embarrassed and lowered their heads. Shen Xiu, and a few nobles, proudly pushed out their chests and showed arrogant pride. Only Nie Li, Ye Ziyun, Lu Piao and a few other nobles kept calm.

Nie Li looked to the side. Du Ze was wearing slightly worn out clothing. He was clenching his fists tightly, and biting his lips. Du Ze came from a commoner family. His family’s circumstance is extremely tough. But Nie Li knows that Du Ze’s self-esteem is very strong.

In Nie Li’s past life, Du Ze was very hard working, even though his family’s circumstance wasn’t good. His talent isn’t too bad, either. With enormous effort, he became a Gold rank Demon Spiritualist. He had achieved this without the support of large resources, and no exceptional talent. He depended on his own hard work to reach such a level. One can only imagine how much effort he had to put in.

Before Glory City was destroyed, many noble families were thinking of how to escape. Only the commoners fought for Glory City down to their last breath.

Du Ze is Nie Li’s friend, one of his most esteemed friends.

Seeing Shen Xiu’s face full of contempt, Nie Li could not help feeling a surge of anger within his heart. In his past life, before Glory City was broken through, the Sacred Family was the first to flee. Therefore, Nie Li does not have any pleasant impressions for them. Whether it’s Shen Yue or Shen Xiu, there weren’t any redeeming qualities. In his past life Shen Xiu was very harsh, which lead to Nie Li disliking her.

“Teacher Shen Xiu, I have a question,” Nie Li suddenly spoke.

All the students were listening quietly and Nie Li suddenly interrupted her speech. This made Shen Xiu unhappy. Shen Xiu recognized Nie Li since he was the one who had covet over Ye Ziyun. The words she spoke previously was directed at Nie Li. Who would have thought Nie Li would actually speak up?

She coldly snorted, “What is it?”

“Teacher Shen Xiu says that Glory City is the only one that survived the Age of Darkness, that we are the only surviving humans. What proof do you have on this statement? May I ask if teacher ever went out of the St. Ancestral Mountains and visited the Endless Desert, the Toxic Forest, the Blood Moon Marsh, the Spirit Gulf, the Heavenly Luster Mountains, and the Northern Snow before?” Nie Li asked.

As someone who was reborn, and retained his past experiences, Nie Li can completely look down on Shen Xiu.

“What Heavenly Luster Mountain? What Northern Snow?” Shen Xiu frowned. She has heard of the Endless Desert, Toxic Forest and Blood Moon Marsh before, but those places were very far away from the St. Ancestral Mountains. She has only heard of them in legends.

Shen Xiu snorted, “I’ve been in Glory City since birth, and have never been to those places.”

Nie Li smiled faintly and said, “Since Teacher Shen Xiu never went to those places, how can you be so sure that we are the only human beings alive?”

Shen Xiu was at a loss for words.

The students in the class started to talk quietly. They have no idea what kind of places Nie Li spoke about. Ye Ziyun, who was sitting far away, began to show interest that flashed across her eyes. She curiously look at Nie Li. How did Nie Li know of those places?

Shen Yue who was sitting beside Ye Ziyun slightly frowned his brows. He looked towards Nie Li, and realized he was quite handsome. Nie Li wasn’t below him in terms of looks. Unknowingly, he felt a sense of crisis within his heart.

Seeing the students below discussing away, Shen Xiu’s face was extremely displeased and scoffed, “So what? How can you prove that we are not the last surviving human beings?”

“Proof?”

Nie Li faintly smiled. His experiences from his past life is the proof. Mankind’s wisdom is amazing. After experiencing the Age of Darkness, a lot of humans still survived. They built many monumental cities. But he couldn’t say that out loud. Instead he calmly said, “Let me tell Teacher Shen Xiu a story. There was once a frog in the depth of the well. Since his birth, he has always been in that well. Since the start he could only see a part of the sky, so he claimed that the sky is only as big as the hole of the well. But is the sky only the size of the hole? We could only say that the frog is ignorant.”

Listening to what Nie Li just said, the students in the class couldn’t help laughing. They felt that what Nie Li said makes sense. And the idiom, “a frog viewing the sky from the bottom of the well”, is indirectly calling Teacher Shen Xiu a frog.

“Viewing the sky from the bottom of the well, what an appropriate description,” a few girls said while giggling away. They all disliked Shen Xiu, and couldn’t help looking at Nie Li full of admiration, since Nie Li was the only one daring enough to openly insult a teacher in class.

“You……” Shen Xiu started as she stared at Nie Li. She was furious to the point of almost vomiting blood. Nie Li actually compared her to an ignorant frog. She has never encountered such a rampant student.

Ye Ziyun, who was sitting far away, couldn’t control her laughter as well. She realised that Nie Li is quite interesting and is rather eloquent with with his words. He had actually made Teacher Shen Xiu speechless.

Ye Ziyun’s a natural beauty. Her smile was fascinating. Nie Li winked towards Ye Ziyun and smiled.

Seeing Nie Li’s expression, Ye Ziyun immediately turned her head back, and thought in her heart, ‘Such audacity!’

Nie Li’s impression in her heart was still a bad student.

Watching Nie Li not only choke Teacher Shen Xiu, but also tease Ye Ziyun, Lu Piao couldn’t help raising a thumb at him, thinking this guy’s awesome.

Nie Li looked at Shen Xiu, and continued “Teacher Shen Xiu, I still have another question.”

Shen Xiu was about to die from the anger, but she couldn’t flare up here. She could only reply in bad mood, “What question do you still have?!”

“Teacher Shen Xiu said, ‘a commoner will always remain a commoner, they can never become a noble.’ I have a little question. wasn’t the Legend rank Demon Spiritualist, Ye Mo, a commoner when he was still young?” Nie Li asked, blinking his eyes a few times, and looking at Shen Xiu. “Is Teacher Shen Xiu are not aware of this?”

INSERT INTO `chapter`(`book_id`,`name`,`data`,`number_of_read`,`upload_date`) VALUES(8,'chapter 3','After listening to what Nie Li said, the eyes of the commoners in the class lit up. They are all aware of Lord Ye Mo’s story. He was an example to follow, when one wants to become a powerful existence. Except, the words that Shen Xiu spoke of earlier were simply too harsh. This caused them to be depressed.

“You… In the hundreds of years of Glory City, Lord Ye Mo’s the only one able to climb to the peak by relying on his own ability,” said Shen Xiu, showing a moment of lag. She quickly retaliated with her far-fetched reply.

“But didn’t Teacher Shen Xiu say that it’s impossible? Why are you being so self-contradicting?” Nie Li coldly sneered, “Lord Ye Mo is a clear cut example. No matter if it’s a noble, or commoner, the future’s potential is infinite. Nothing is difficult, as long as one is willing to climb.”

Shen Xiu almost exploded. This guy is too spiteful. He keeps catching the loopholes in her words and constantly attacks. He has no respect for an elder! She gazed coldly at Nie Li. He dared to openly contradict her in front of so many people. She’ll not let Nie Li have it easy in the coming future!

Not far away from Nie Li, Du Ze looked at Nie Li. His eyes were full of gratitude. Although Nie Li is a noble, he still ran the risk of offending Teacher Shen Xiu by helping the commoners speak up. This made him very touched. A teenager’s heart is very primitive, hence, he has already saw Nie Li as his friend.

Shen Xiu sneered, “Smart mouth, you think that putting things this way could change the harsh reality? You only looked at Lord Ye Mo’s glorious moment, but didn’t look at how many people have failed. Not to mention being a Demon Spiritualist, even becoming a Fighter in itself is a difficult thing to achieve. Nie Li, right? You can be considered a bloodline of an Aristocratic family. Since you don’t know when to come and go, I’ll see what kind of talent you have.”

Shen Xiu lowered her head and took a look at the parchment paper in her hands. After taking a glimpse of the contents, she mockingly laughed, “Nie Li: red soul realm, current soul force 5, strength 21. With your talent you can only reach Bronze rank Fighter in your entire life. Wanting to become a Demon Spiritualist is simply impossible. You’re even inferior to some of the commoners. No wonder you dare to speak in this way. You are just trying to hide your own low self-esteem!”

A soul realm’s grade is differentiated by the colours: red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, azure and indigo. Of the seven different grades, red is considered the worst. It’s the weakest to the lowest level. An average person would have an orange or yellow soul realm. Having a green or cyan soul realm could already be considered a genius. As for azure and indigo soul realms, they have only existed in legends.

After hearing what Shen Xiu said, the group of commoner students began to feel sorry for Nie Li. As someone of nobility, Nie Li’s talent could be considered the worst. They fear that it would be difficult for him to have any achievements in his life.

Ye Ziyun looked at Nie Li and sighed gently. Although her impression of Nie Li isn’t good, knowing his talent is so terrible, she couldn’t help feeling sorry for him.

Shen Yue, who is sitting next to Ye Ziyun, curled his lips in disdain. If he knew sooner of Nie Li’s horrible talent, he wouldn’t have considered Nie Li a threat. As Nie Li is simply not qualified. With his horrible talent, he could only live at the lowest levels of Glory City, and he, Shen Yue, was one of the three Major families. As a Sacred Family direct bloodline, how could Nie Li compete with him?

If it wasn’t for Ye Ziyun, he wouldn’t even come to this trash class and be in the company of trash like Nie Li.

Shen Xiu aggressively continued, “With such talent, even within your family, you won’t be able to get any attention. Yet, you act so rampant and are rude to your elders!”

Shen Xiu words made Nie Li recall his past. Before Glory City was destroyed, Nie Li was indeed very weak. Just as Shen Xiu said, he had remained a 3-star Bronze rank and was unable to advance any further. No attention was given to him no matter if it’s within the institute or back with his family. He was treated as if he was dust.

If it wasn’t for Nie Li saving Ye Ziyun without any regard for his life, it wouldn’t even be possible to get his goddess’s favor. Ye Ziyun was already a 1-star Gold rank Demon Spiritualist at that point of time. The distance between the two was like a chasm. In the end, Nie Li wasn’t even qualified to fight beside Ye Ziyun. He could only watch as Ye Ziyun died by the claws of a beast in front of him as her body slowly submerged into the desert sand.

This had always been a needle in Nie Li’s heart.

With pure luck, he walked out of the Endless Desert alive. Nie Li had various mysterious encounters and realised that even the so called “soul force talent” could also be upgraded.

If this was his past life, Nie Li certainly wouldn’t have the courage to refute when being criticized by a teacher. But he’s different now. He’s confident that one day he will let these people who looked down on him know that he will reach a realm that they can never imagine. Since he’s back, he must be indomitable, even if it means slaughtering any gods or buddha stopping his path.

Everyone was surprised that even though Nie Li was being ridiculed by Teacher Shen Xiu, there wasn’t any shame shown on his face.On the contrary, his gaze was firmly locked onto Shen Xiu’s and he said, “Teacher Shen Xiu, you feel that a person’s soul realm decides a person’s future, right? With that despicable character of yours, you’ll only defend the gifted and mock the mediocre. And yet, you still speak a bunch of principles. You’re just merely trying to cover your despicable character.”

Hearing Nie Li’s words, Shen Xiu’s body quivered with anger. She had never met this kind of student. He actually dared to contradict her so badly. Nie Li’s words directly hit the hidden thoughts within her heart, causing her to be enraged. She cursed uncontrollably, “Silence! Who do you think you are to discredit your teacher?!”

Nie Li curled his lips in disdain.

“I feel ashamed to have a teacher like you. I can guarantee that in this class, there will be a lot of commoners exceeding your imagination. They will have unimaginable achievements. Instead of coaching then patiently, you use harsh words to attack their self-confidence. You’re not worthy to be a teacher! Although my talent is weak, so what? One day, I will become a Legend rank Demon Spiritualist like Lord Ye Mo and marry the most beautiful woman in Glory City!”

As he spoke, Nie Li’s gaze fell on Ye Ziyun, who was sitting far away. His eyes shined with an absolute resolve.

When she saw Nie Li looking towards her, without knowing why, Ye Ziyun suddenly felt her heart speed up. Her cheeks were burning red. She had never thought that Nie Li would actually be so bold and say something like this in class. After meeting Nie Li’s gaze, she knew his meaning was clear. Except, in her heart, she doesn’t have any feelings for Nie Li. After hearing Nie Li’s speech, she had an indescribable feeling within her.

Seeing Ye Ziyun’s expression, Shen Yue’s face turned a dull colour. Although he and Nie Li aren’t of the same standard, he still felt a bit threatened by him.

“Hahaha! This is the funniest joke I’ve ever heard! A red soul realm actually said that he wants to become a Legend rank Demon Spiritualist like Lord Ye Mo. Even when Lord Ye Mo was younger, he was already tested and showed to have amazing talent. He had a cyan soul realm! You think success relies on luck alone? Ridiculous!” Shen Xu mocked mercilessly, “Rather than being a smart mouth here, why don’t you start learning seriously?”

Nie Li’s next words were powerful and resonating.

“I know your heart is full of contempt, but one day I will shut your mouth with hard facts. Aptitude cannot determine a person’s achievement! We use the weak to defeat the strong, to overcome the heavens! We practitioners are already challenging the impossible by going against the way of the heavens!”

Nie Li’s words couldn’t stop causing the students in the class to feel their blood surging. Practicing was already going against the way of the heavens. If one did not oppose the heavens, how could they talk about practice?

Nie Li enunciated powerfully, “Without a continuously fighting heart, without the courage to turn the impossible possible, even possessing extraordinary talent would be useless. Since I, Nie Li, was born into this world, I shall challenge the impossible! Teacher Shen Xiu, how about having a bet with me?”

Although Nie Li experienced numerous setbacks in his previous life, he never gave up. Since the heavens gave him the chance to be reborn, in this life he will use unimaginable speed to climb to the top.

“What bet?” Shen Xiu sneered.

“We’ll bet that on the coming test in two months time, I will be able to reach Bronze rank. If I fail to do so, I will resign from the institute. If I reach Bronze rank, then you will resign, how about it?” Nie Li said unyieldingly, looking at Shen Xiu.

Listening to what Nie Li said, everyone was taken aback. They were all surprised that Nie Li actually proposed this kind of bet with Teacher Shen Xiu. Although they were hoping that Nie Lie wins, they felt that there’s no way that Nie Lie can win.

“Hahaha. You’re funny enough to actually say that you will reach Bronze rank within two months. You think that you can raise your soul force from 5 to 100 in two months?” Shen Xiu face was full of spite. Has Nie Li gone crazy?

“I only asked one question. Do you dare or not?” Nie Li ignored what Shen Xiu just said.

“That being the case, why would I not dare? I do not believe an egotistical brat like you can achieve anything. Who do you think you are boasting to?” Shen Xiu angrily snorted, “Such rudeness to your teacher. For the next two months, you will stand at the back of the classroom and listen to the class!”

Shen Xiu’s famous for being unreasonable. Nie Li looked contemptuously at Shen Xiu. So what if he’s standing at the back of the class, for Nie Li this little punishment is superficial.

“Since Teacher Shen Xiu agreed to the bet, don’t regret it later,” said Nie Li as he strolled to the back of the class.

“I’ll regret it? What a joke. Don’t come crying to me later!” Shen Xiu laughed.

Seeing Nie Li standing at the back, a few noble kids started to mockingly whisper.

“The future Legend rank Demon Spiritualist got punished standing!”

“Tsk tsk, so he’s afraid of withdrawal from the institute!”

“Weren’t you being egotistic a while ago?”

“Two months to raise his soul force from 5 to 100. Who does he think he is? Even when Lord Ye Mo was younger, he couldn’t even reach a such frightening speed.”

Shen Xiu sneered. So what if Nie Li is being egotistic. Doesn’t she still have the final word in the classroom? She naturally didn’t bother with what Nie Li said. Two months to raise his soul force from 5 to 100. Shen Xiu thought of it as a joke. This will absolutely not happen! Just look forward to Nie Li’s withdrawal from the institute.

Because Nie Li was punished to stand at the back of the class by Shen Xiu, Du Ze was silent for a moment. He gritted his teeth, then rose up and went to stand beside Nie Li. Nie Li was punished for helping the commoners speak up, so naturally, he wants to stand together with Nie Li.

Seeing that Du Ze stood beside Nie Li at the back of the class, Shen Xiu’s eyes darkened and hummed, “Since you also like standing, you can stand together with him.”

Nie Li and Du Ze looked at each other. Their eyes flashed a sense of rapport and lightly smiled at each other.

At this moment, Nie Li felt as though he was back in his past life when he and Du Ze were best friends. Du Ze is still that Du Ze.

After Du Ze stood at the side of Nie Li, Lu Piao was submerged in his thoughts for a moment and then stood beside Nie Li.

Nie Li smiled as he asked, “Why are you here?”

Lu Piao shrugged, “Sitting down is pretty boring. I feel more cool standing, can’t I?”

“Haha, that suits you!” Nie Li laughed. Lu Piao is still the same as his past. Although he speaks a lot of bullshit, he is very loyal. This punishment had nothing to do with Lu Piao, but he thought of Nie Li as a friend, and friends should share their fates together.

Successively, three other commoner kids stood up and stood by Nie Li’s side. Nie Li belonged to a noble family, but he took the risk of withdrawing from the institute to speak up for them.They were grateful for that, so they felt that they have to support Nie Li.

With these brothers by his side, Nie Li felt that it wasn’t so bad to be punished and his mood turned exceptionally cheerful.

When she saw this, Shen Xiu’s facial expression turned ugly. She put on a cold face and continued her lecture.

“After being tested, among the students in this class, Ye Ziyun, with a cyan soul realm, has a soul force of 86. Shen Yue and Xiao Ning\'er both have a green soul realm, with a soul force of 78. They will soon reach 1-star Bronze rank. Congratulations to them!” Shen Xiu lightly said. Her gaze fell on Nie Li for a moment. This is real talent, what’s Nie Li compared to them?

Listening to Shen Xiu’s words, the students in the class all cried out in surprise. A cyan soul realm, with a soul force of 86! Such an amazing person is actually in their class. With such powerful talent, she’s got the chance to become a Legend rank Demon Spiritualist in her lifetime!

As for Shen Yue and Xiao Ning\'er, they also had extraordinary talent. Their future achievements were limitless!

Ye Ziyun’s origins were unknown, she was a fresh and beautiful appearance with an extraordinary talent and mysterious background. This made her the most dazzling figure in the class. As for Xiao Ning\'er, her appearance was not any less than Ye Ziyun, but her talent was slightly inferior compared to her.

No matter what, ordinary people have no hope of catching up to them.

INSERT INTO `chapter`(`book_id`,`name`,`data`,`number_of_read`,`upload_date`) VALUES(8,'chapter 4','Nie Li glanced towards Xiao Ning\'er. She had a slim figure, was wearing a short, yellow skirt, and a pair of high heeled boots. Her black was hair draped over her shoulders. She had bright, clear eyes, curved eyebrows, and long eyelashes that slightly trembled. Her flawless white skin revealed touches of pink, and delicate lips were like rose petals.

Aside from having a charming feel to her, she had an indescribable, wild beauty and a cold expression on her face that added a different kind of taste.

Nie Li’s eyes went heavy when he remembered that Xiao Ning\'er was the first child of the Winged Dragon Family. She was part of one of the seven Noble families. Her soul force talent was only beneath Ye Ziyun. Before Glory City was destroyed, she had already become a Silver rank Demon Spiritualist. Together with Ye Ziyun, they became the younger generation’s twin gemini.

The only thing is, in order to curry favor with one of the three Major families, the Winged Dragon Family forced Xiao Ning\'er to marry into the Sacred Family. She would’ve had to marry Shen Yue’s elder brother. But she was unwilling, hence, she left her family and went into the St. Ancestral Mountain’s Black Devil Forest and never came back. She’s an unyielding woman.

Nie Li felt sorry for Xiao Ning\'er. If given the chance, he will definitely help Xiao Ning\'er in this life. But if asked if he had any affection for Xiao Ning\'er, there would be none. In Nie Li’s heart, there’s only Ye Ziyun.

“In the Fighter and Demon Spiritualist tests in two months time, I hope that there will be a few 1-star Bronze rank Demon Spiritualists. Both myself and the Holy Orchid Institute will feel proud of you!” Shen Xiu laughed.

Bronze, Silver, Gold, Black Gold, Legend, these five ranks are further broken down into 1 to 5 star levels, and thus obtaining a 1-star Bronze rank is considered the starting point.

Once a Fighter’s strength or Demon Spiritualist’s soul force reaches 100, they can be considered a 1-star Bronze rank. Entering the entry level is extremely difficult. Lots of people are unable to step into the entry level to become a real Fighter or Demon Spiritualist.

Hearing Shen Xiu’s words, the students in the class started whispering to one another. In order to become a 1-star Bronze rank Fighter you must to be able to lift up a hundred pound rock, and break a tree as thick as an arm with a punch in order to reach 1-star Bronze rank. For these kids, it’s simply too difficult. Unless one has been consuming elixirs since birth, it will be hard to achieve. As for becoming a Demon Spiritualist, one is required to refine a large amount of soul force within their body. This is a lot harder to accomplish compared to becoming a Fighter.

Soul realms are divided into seven colours: red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, azure and indigo. A normal human would have a red soul realm. For them to become a Demon Spiritualist it is nearly impossible. They would normally choose to become a Fighter instead. As for people with orange and yellow soul realms, they’re more suitable to train in soul force. The people with green or cyan soul realms are considered extraordinary talents.

The students in the class all looked at Ye Ziyun, Shen Yue and Xiao Ning\'er. They envied them because they are the only ones that could become a 1-star Bronze rank in less than half a year.

After becoming a 1-star Bronze rank, they can then enter into the official Fighter class or official Demon Spiritualist class. At that time, they won’t be in the same class as them.

Feeling the gaze of other students, Shen Yue proudly puffed his chest out. As a member of the Sacred Family, he’s had all kinds of elixirs ever since he was young. He has already long surpassed his peers. It would be an easy thing to get his soul force to hit 100 in two months. He shall await the test in two months time.

Shen Yue looked at the elegant Ye Ziyun beside him. Only he’s worth of her, Nie Li’s considered nothing! He actually dared to bet with his aunt that he will become a 1-star Bronze rank in two months. So egotistical and ignorant! Nie Li thought that it’s easy to become a 1-star Bronze rank? A red soul realm trash dared to make such an egotistical statement? Ha!

Ye Ziyun and Xiao Ning\'er looked each other in the eyes. They both had superior origins, which was certainly not bad. Ye Ziyun always wanted to be friends with Xiao Ning\'er, but Xiao Ning\'er had always seen her as a rival. She set her as the target and continued to work hard to reach her.

Shen Xiu looked towards Nie Li with contempt in her eyes and spoke in a disdainful tone, “As for those who claim they can reach 1-star Bronze rank within two months, I want to see to what extent they can actually reach!”

One’s soul realm and physical condition determines a person’s cultivation speed. For Nie Li’s situation, according to normal levels, he would need at least three to five years to reach entry level. Even if he becomes 1-star Bronze rank,  becoming a Demon Spiritualist while having a red soul realm is simply dreaming.

Nie Li did not put Shen Xiu’s words to heart.

“Two months? There’s still time to spare,” said Nie Li as the side of his mouth upturned, showing a faint confident smile.

‘Watch how I’ll become 1-star Bronze rank within two months!’

Privately, Nie Li, Lu Piao and Du Ze were conversing.

“Nie Li, do you like Ye Ziyun?” Lu Piao asked looking at Nie Li.

“Yes!” Nie Li said truthfully.

Lu Piao stared into Nie Li’s eyes, after a while he sighed, “Ye Ziyun’s a beauty indeed. And seeing that you’re my brother, I shall not fight with you. But as a brother, I have to warn you, Ye Ziyun’s identity is too noble. She isn’t someone we can match.”

Although his family belongs to one of the twelve aristocratic families, Ye Ziyun’s identity compared to him is simply astronomical.

“You two, can you be more realistic? Ye Ziyun’s a super genius with a cyan soul realm! Soon she’ll become a 1-star Bronze rank Demon Spiritualist. I estimate that in two months time she’ll be able to enter the official Demon Spiritualist class. After entering the official Demon Spiritualist class, her cultivation will definitely soar. Whether she remembers you or not is still a problem. What I hate the most is your kind of noble offspring is constantly thinking of how to chase after girls, when you don’t even know how to work hard and train!” Du Ze snorted, relentlessly.

“What do you mean by noble offspring constantly thinking of chasing after girls? You’re slandering! I’ve always been hard-working okay? At most, I’ve only used half a day to think of girls!” Lu Piao shrugged his shoulders.

“Good heavens! What kind of people did I get involved with?” said Du Ze, rolling his eyes.

Du Ze’s talent isn’t bad. He has a yellow soul realm and works very hard with his training. Plus, he would have a mysterious encounter later on, which would allow him to reach the stage of 1-star Gold rank Demon Spiritualist. He would lead his family and become one of the aristocratic families. These are amazing achievements.

Du Ze’s a very loyal person, but slightly old fashioned and takes things seriously. In contrast with Du Ze, Lu Piao’s a dandyish young master. Although he only has a red soul realm, he had high Fighter talents. If he puts in the effort and works hard, his cultivation would definitely soar. However, he’s simply too lazy. In Nie Li’s previous life, he only reached Silver rank, had a huge difference compared to Du Ze.

But life is intriguing. Although they are two completely different kinds of people, they still became brothers in their previous life.

Listening to Lu Piao and Du Ze’s arguments, Nie Li in his previous life used to feel that it was unhealthy. But right now, Nie Li’s heart was touched. He has these kinds of brothers, how fantastic!

“Nie Li, I recommend you to give up. Focus on your training instead,” Du Ze said, persuading Nie Li seriously. If Nie Li really fell for her, it’ll be an extremely sad thing.

In his past life, Nie Li couldn’t get away from loving her. After he found out about Shen Yue and Ye Ziyun’s engagement, he became heart broken. But in this life, if he’s still as useless as a scrap of wood, he might as well commit suicide.

“Don’t worry, I’m well aware of the things that I want to do and they will definitely be accomplished!” Nie Li spoke with confidence.

Listening to Nie Li’s words, Du Ze and Lu Piao staggered for a moment. They’re unable to imagine where Nie Li got such confidence. After they saw Nie Li’s expression, they had a feeling that he could certainly accomplish it. They couldn’t help but be influenced by Nie Li’s mood.

De Zu thought for a moment and spoke up, “Fine. No matter what you do, we will always support you!”

Being punished and standing together, caused them to produce a strong brotherly relationship.

“Du Ze, Lu Piao, I will let the both of you become the strongest Demon Spiritualists!” Nie Li said heavily. In his previous life, Du Ze and Lu Piao shared life and death with him. They had fought and saved his life many times and now that he’s back, he’ll naturally help Du Ze and Lu Piao fulfill their dreams.

“Forget it. I only have a red soul realm. With the support of my family’s elixirs, becoming a Fighter wouldn’t be an issue. Becoming a demon spiritualist would be too hard!” said Lu Piao, starting to back out.

“What’s the use of becoming a Fighter? The higher you climb, the harder it is to train and a Fighter can’t be a match for a Demon Spiritualist. In the battlefield, a Legend rank Fighter isn’t even worth a Black Gold rank Demon Spiritualist. You must know that Demon Spiritualists are powerful combat forces!” argued Du Ze. He was filled with hope to become a Demon Spiritualist. If he wants to do something, he will give it his best. That’s his principle.

“No need to become a Legend rank fighter. If I can become a Gold rank Fighter, I’d be satisfied,” Lu Piao said frankly, completely unmoved.

Du Ze’s speechless. Nothing can be said to an aimless person.

“You have a red soul realm, so what? I also a red soul realm,” Nie Li said, looking towards Lu Piao.

Lu Piao and Du Ze were puzzled. Nie Li has a red soul realm, yet he actually had the confidence to say that he’ll reach 1-star Bronze rank in two months. Could he have some special methods?

“Nie Li, what methods do you have to refine soul force in order to raise your Demon Spiritualist level?” Du Ze asked. He’s very curious. From what he knows there’s no shortcut in training one’s soul force.

“Just listen to me. As long as you don’t back down, you can become a powerful Demon Spiritualist.”

“Back down? Never!” Du Ze firmly said. He will become stronger to change his family’s fate; in this matter, he’ll never back out.

If it’s possible to become a Demon Spiritualist, Lu Piao is naturally very happy. If he can become a Demon Spiritualist, he won’t be beaten by his dad for being lazy. Lu Piao belongs to the kind of people where if there’s an opportunity to slack off, he wouldn’t let it go.

“Will it be very troublesome?” Lu Piao mumbled.

Du Ze threw him a look. This fella is hopeless. He wants to become a Demon Spiritualist without any difficulties. To become a Demon Spiritualist, how can it not be troublesome? If he can become a Demon Spiritualist, he’d do anything. No matter how hard it is!

“It’s not troublesome,” replied Nie Li as he shook his head. His complexion was normal when he continued, “We just need a lot of money.”

“If it can be solved as long as you have money, this is too easy,” stated Lu Piao as he loosened his breath, “How much do you need? I have a lot. I saved up two thousand demon spirit coins. If I can become a Demon Spiritualist, I can afford to spend it all.”

If two thousand demon spirit coins can get you a Demon Spiritualist title, it’s simply too awesome.

Nie Li looked at Lu Piao. Lu Piao had a lot of nerve to think that two thousand demon spirit coins can be considered a lot.

Helplessly, Nie Li said, “What can two thousand demon spirit coins do? Of course, it’s not enough. You’ll need at least millions of demon spirit coins, or even tens of millions!”

Tens of millions of demon spirit coins? Du Ze and Lu Piao took a deep breath. One million demon spirit coins. That’s the same as an Aristocratic family’s annual income! Where can they get so much money?

INSERT INTO `chapter`(`book_id`,`name`,`data`,`number_of_read`,`upload_date`) VALUES(8,'chapter 5','Demon spirit coins are the currency used in Glory City. Usually, two to three thousand demon spirit coins would be sufficient for a commoner family’s annual expenses. The value of items in Glory City is measured with demon spirit coins. For example: battle armours, demon crystals, demon beast furs, elixirs and various other items.

The Holy Orchid Institute’s annual school fee would be around three thousand demon spirit coins. For a commoner family, this would be a huge expense for them. But a lot of commoner families would rather live frugally and send their children to the Holy Orchid Institute. This is because, once they become a Fighter or a Demon Spiritualist, even if it’s only Bronze rank, they can change their family’s fate.

A Bronze rank Fighter, if they join the army and become a soldier, would have an annual salary of about five to six thousand demon spirit coins. At the same time, they can also venture into the St. Ancestral Mountains and gain more benefits from it.

Nie Li belongs to the Heavenly Mark Family. It is a relatively declining Aristocratic family. The Patriarch is a 1-star Gold rank Demon Spiritualist. The family’s annual income is around six hundred thousand demon spirit coins. The family’s annual expenses is very large. Just the expenses of the children’s school fees would be around three hundred thousand demon spirit coins. This, along with various other expenses, often made the family struggle to make ends meet. With no choice but to sell some of the family business to support themselves, the Heavenly Mark Family was able to get all of the younger generations into the Holy Orchid Institute.

The Patriarch once said that only an outstanding member of the younger generations could get the family to rise once again. Even if they had to live with a high toll, they would let every single young generation the largest nurturing they can give.

In his previous life, Nie Li didn’t quite understand this sentence. He felt strange about the Patriarch, Nie Hai’s actions. The Patriarch was very strict with them. After his rebirth, Nie Li could finally understand the Patriarch’s care and thought.

As a member of the Heavenly Mark Family, he also wanted the family to grow stronger and become Glory City’s top level.

After his rebirth, Nie Li’s memory had a lot of powerful cultivation techniques. Before that, he would have to make some money to buy a few primary soul crystals. In order to test his soul realm’s attributes he needs a soul crystal. Then, he can decide on which cultivation technique to practice with. If the cultivation technique matches one’s soul realm attributes, then training would be more effective.

Dong! Dong! Dong!

The bell went off throughout Glory City. Class has ended.

The Holy Orchid Institute’s students rushed out of the huge gates, and passed through the bustling street in front. The merchants sounded off one after another.

“Latest Bronze rank battle armours! With Snow Wind Patterns inscribed on them! Noble ladies and gentlemen, are you interested?” A vendor with a grey tunic greeted the crowd with so much enthusiasm. This had soon attracted the attention of many students. Bronze rank armour isn’t something an ordinary student can afford. However, within the Holy Orchid Institute, there’s still a lot of children of nobility. Some of them are extremely loaded, and they can sell to those rich students if they were lucky enough.

“Look, Bronze rank armour with Snow Wind Patterns inscribed on it!”

The students were excited and talked to one another. A pair of gauntlets were exuding a deep blue light. The surface was covered with mysterious carvings and revealed a faint chilling frost.

“How much is this?” One student asked in a low voice.

“Sixty thousand demon spirit coins!” The vendor said while smiling.

“Good heavens, so expensive!”

An ordinary family couldn’t even accumulate sixty thousand demon spirit coins in ten years.

“This is Bronze rank armour with Snow Wind Patterns inscribed on it. The Snow Wind Pattern was drawn using the blood of a Snow Wind Banshee. The banshee was at its prime before being killed. The Snow Wind Banshee isn’t easy to hunt. Their characteristics also made the gauntlets gain a strong attacking ability. This is definitely a suitable armour for Snow Wind type Fighters or Demon Spiritualists!” The vendor bragged as he introduced the armour.

Many students looked at the pair of gauntlets with nostalgia, but they still left. Such an expensive item isn’t something they can afford.

“If Bronze rank armour alone costs sixty thousand demon spirit coins, then wouldn’t Silver rank armour and Gold rank armour be even more expensive?” Lu Piao muttered. His monthly allowance was only about five hundred demon spirit coins. Lu Piao’s family has a lot of business, so Lu Piao can be considered well off. In his previous life, Lu Piao would often help Nie Li and Du Ze. But even if Lu Piao had some money, Bronze rank armour isn’t something he can afford.

As Nie Li, Lu Piao, and Du Ze walked, they looked around. This street was filled with all kinds of items. No matter what item, be it expensive or cheap, can be found here.

“Nie Li, what are you planning?” asked Lu Piao, confused while Nie Li looked around.

As they were talking, a figure arrived in front of the vendor.

“Look, it’s Shen Yue!” Lu Piao stated, directing Shen Yue’s location with his mouth, “And also Ye Ziyun!”

Nie Li looked towards that direction. He only saw Ye Ziyun and a few girls happily chatting. That pretty face and sweet smile of hers was full of sunshine. Among the group of girls, Ye Ziyun’s smile was definitely the most dazzling, which made everyone look at her. Everything around here became more vibrant because of Ye Ziyun’s existence.

Shen Yue also looked at her from time to time.

“Very good, I’m lacking Bronze rank gauntlets. Wrap this Bronze rank gauntlet up for me,” Shen Yue lightly said to the vendor.

“YES, YOUNG MASTER!”

The vendor immediately grinned upon hearing Shen Yue’s words and quickly wrapped the gauntlet up.

“Here’s sixty thousand demon spirit coins.”

Shen Yue took out six demon crystal cards. A single demon crystal card represents ten thousand demon spirit coins.

He made sixty thousand demon spirit coins look light. With an ‘I don’t give a shit’ kind of expression he placed the bronze rank gauntlets into his interspatial ring.

(TLN: The raw doesn’t have ‘don’t give a shit’ but I got no idea how to translate it lol)

Several girls around him let out light muffled voices. He easily took out sixty thousand demon spirit coins, so rich! Several of the  slightly pretty girls had the look in their eyes brighten up. They threw flirtatious gazes at Shen Yue. However, Shen Yue treated them as though they were invisible. He proudly looked towards Nie Li’s group of three. Then, he looked towards Ye Ziyun. His eyes clearly said, ‘I only have eyes for you.’

“How despicable!” Lu Piao growled, “This is a silver bullet attack!”

(TLN : Erm.. sort of a money attack? As in showing others that he’s filthy rich)

“Tyrant! Easily throwing out sixty thousand demon spirit coins, and even having an interspatial ring.” Du Ze spread out his hands. Shaking his head, he looked at Nie Li and said, “Nie Li, people like him are handsome and rich. What can you compete against him with?”

“Hehe. Ziyun doesn’t care about that amount of money,” Nie Li casually spoke. He swept his gaze towards Ye Ziyun. She completely ignored Shen Yue’s action, and was talking to the few girls beside her. Her eyes were occasionally looking at Xiao Ning\'er, but Xiao Ning\'er stood absent mindedly to one side.

Xiao Ning\'er’s expression was cold. She’s usually a lone wolf, and doesn’t have much contact with the other students.

Nie Li knows that what Ye Ziyun wants the most right now is friendship. In his previous life, Ye Ziyun always wanted to be friends with Xiao Ning\'er, but their identities led them further apart instead.

Looking at Ye Ziyun’s expression, Shen Yue was somewhat disappointed.

“Fine, Ye Ziyun indeed doesn’t care about money. Nie Li, she wouldn’t like females, right? If so, your game’s over,” Lu Piao blinked, teasing Nie Li.

Nie Li laughed. He naturally won’t put Lu Piao’s words to heart. In his previous life, he was Ye Ziyun’s only man.

“Let’s go, I’m starting my plan!”

Du Ze and Lu Piao expression turned solemn, nodded their heads.

“Lu Piao, go buy two crossbows and five hundred crossbow bolts. A crossbow costs one hundred sixty demon spirit coins each and the bolts cost thirty demon spirit coins each, don’t get cheated by hawkers!” Nie Li told Lu Piao, “We’ll meet up at the school’s training ground.”

“Okay!” said Lu Piao nodding his head and feeling a bit curious in his heart. Did Nie Li buy crossbows and crossbow bolts in the past, since he knows the price of them?

Nie Li’s monthly allowance is only fifty demon spirit coins, so he doesn’t have enough to buy expensive things.

“Du Ze, we’ll go buy Black Pool Grass,” Nie Li said. Black Pool Grass has a certain paralysis effect.

Du Ze’s situation is even worse than Nie Li’s. Naturally, Nie Li wouldn’t let Du Ze use his money. So when buying those herbs, Nie Li was the one paying.

Black Pool Grass is very cheap. One demon spirit coin can buy a bunch of it. In addition, Nie Li also bought some low level fusing agents and went to a small hill at the side of Glory City to collect some Zoysia Grass.

“What are you planning to do?” Du Ze curiously asked.

Nie Li laughed mysteriously, “Black Pool Grass has a certain paralysis effect, but the efficiency is very low. It is generally used to smear on wounds to relieve some pain. As for Zoysia Grass, it is a very common weed so no one has found a use for them yet. However, if it’s used with a fusing agent and Black Pool Grass, it can greatly strengthen the paralysis effect of the Black Pool Grass.”

Du Ze was stunned for a moment and then asked, “How strong is the paralysis effect?”

Nie Li laughed and said, “It doesn’t have much effect on ordinary demon beasts. The effect is worse than a low-grade paralyzing agent. But did you know that the Horned Sheep never eats Zoysia Grass?”

“Horned Sheep?” repeated Du Ze and went silent for a moment. As if he vaguely guessed something, his eyes lit up, “Nie Li, would you happen to be an alchemist?”

“An alchemist?” Nie Li thought awhile and laughed, “I guess so.”

An alchemist is referring to those who use herbs to refine elixirs or people that allocate prescriptions. Nie Li isn’t an alchemist. In his previous life, he only had slight knowledge of them. However, Glory City’s alchemist standards was simply too low. They can’t even be considered real alchemists. Nie Li can look down on those so called ‘alchemists’ in Glory City. When Nie Li was having his adventure around the continent, he entered the Toxic Forest. The people living in Toxic Forest had survived countless attacks from poisonous demon beasts. They can be considered real alchemists!

Nie Li started mixing the grasses and fusing agents, getting a total of six full bottles of the drug.

Holy Orchid Institute Training Grounds

The training grounds were established by the Legend rank Demon Spiritualist Lord Ye Mo and the principal of the school, who was a Black Gold rank Demon Spiritualist. The training grounds were surrounded by towering walls. Every year, experts in Glory City would capture some low level demon beasts and place them into the training grounds. Any Holy Orchid Institute student who is below Silver rank, can enter the grounds. Students can hunt the demon beasts inside and obtain fur, demon crystals, and various other beast materials from them and dispose of them freely at their own choice. Some of the poorer students can hunt inside the training ground to help with their family’s financial situation.

Nie Li’s group of three haven’t even reached 1-star Bronze rank, yet. So the place that they are going to is the training grounds safest area. There are only Horned Sheeps in that area. Although Horned Sheeps are very aggressive in nature, they are still herbivores. Therefore, their attacks would only cause serious injuries. So they can be considered safe.

Nie Li’s group of three entered the training grounds after they had their identities verified by the guards at the entrance.

Training Grounds Apprenticeship Area

Within the sparse trees, there would be patches of grass fields with Horned Sheep slowly pacing them. Their eyes were red. Occasionally, they would prick up their ears to listen. Once an outsider enters their territory, they would mercilessly attack him.

Suddenly, an abnormal sound was heard. The Horned Sheep closest to Nie Li’s group let out a growl and rushed towards the direction of the abnormal sound.

Simply outrageous!” Lu Piao looking at the Horned Sheep that was charging towards him. This scared the crap out of him, making him stumble as he ran backwards.

Meanwhile, Du Ze and Nie Li were hiding in the bush. They were holding crossbows in their hands.

“My goodness! This Horned Sheep is so scary! Shoot, shoot it!” Lu Piao yelled. When he saw the Horned Sheep getting closer, he ran nonstop.

“This Lu Piao, didn’t we agree to have him stay still and not move? The Horned Sheep would have surely fallen for the trap. However, once he ran, the sheep deviated from the trap’s direction,” Nie Li frowned. The trap is actually a small, two finger pit and once the Horned Sheep carelessly stepped into the trap, it would have definitely fractured its leg. Firing bolts at it, once that happened, would have caused the result to be much better.

Seeing Lu Piao run in a panic, Du Ze also got nervous and continuously pulled the trigger at the sheep. *shu shu shu* Three crossbow bolts shot out from the crossbow.

That Horned Sheep is a demon-ized creature. it hasn’t been injured so the reaction of the Horned Sheep is extremely fast. When it sensed the three bolts that were being shot at its direction, with its fast reflexes, it immediately made a few jumps and caused the three crossbow bolts to graze passed the sheep, hence, dodging the bolt.

“What? Missed?”

Lu Piao was perplexed as the Horned Sheep’s horn closed in on him. Thinking that Nie Li and Du Ze actually made this kind of mistake; he almost bursted into tears in his heart. He began to think that he made a mistake in making friends. If the sharp horn reaches him, it will instantly be able to make his ass flowering.

When he saw the Horned Sheep dodge the crossbow bolts, and continued its charge at Lu Piao, made Du Ze’s hands covered in sweat. If he tried to load another bolt onto the crossbow, he would be too late. He could imagine the scene of Lu Piao’s butt being stabbed by the Horned Sheep’s horn in his head.

“Nie Li, what should we do….” Du Ze immediately went silent after speaking halfway. He was afraid to disturb Nie Li.

Nie Li half squatted. His left arm was straightened with the crossbow over his left arm. His right hand was clenching the trigger. His eyes were glued to the sight and the crossbow was so stable it was as though it was placed onto a holder.

Du Ze had an indescribable feeling. Nie Li had yet to fire a bolt, but Du Ze had a feeling that the bolt will surely hit the Horned Sheep. Nie Li, at this moment, was like a cheetah crouching in the bushes, waiting for his prey. He was releasing an awe-inspiring aura.

Although his physique is weak and he was not even a Bronze rank Fighter yet, the rich experience from his previous life was still there. The experience was accumulated with every bloody battle Nie Li went through. Some were even near death experiences. No matter what kind of weapon, be it swords, crossbows, or even a piece of metal. In the hands of Nie Li, they would all become deadly weapons. Even though Nie Li wasn’t a Bronze rank Fighter yet, he had countless methods to kill a Bronze rank or even a Silver rank Fighter.

The surrounding area seemed to have only one person there. The look Nie Li had in his eyes was like a hawk waiting to catch its prey.

Nie Li’s slightly significant tender cheeks, firm look, and gestures would give others a feeling of a ‘Lake without depth.’

Psh!

Nie Li pulled the trigger and a crossbow bolt was unleashed. The bolt that left turned into a silvery light and gracefully flew quickly. The angle that Nie Li targeted was in the blind spot of the Horned Sheep’s sight.

“It hit!”

Seeing the bolt fly passed, Du Ze’s heart was surprised. Nie Li gave him a weird feeling. It was as though he was a veteran shooter.

The Horned Sheep didn’t manage to dodge in time.

Plop!

The bolt hit the back leg of the horned sheep.

Thud!

The horned sheep fell onto the ground wailing, landed in front of Lu Piao and raised dust all around it.

Lu Piao was gasping for air. He was extremely nervous. When he saw the Horned Sheep wailing nonstop, couldn’t help thinking, ‘My god, that was too exciting! My goodness, my butt was spared.’

If Nie Li’s bolt was slightly slower, he would have been hit by that Horned Sheep!

If the bolt was an ordinary bolt, this kind of injury wouldn’t even affect a demonized Horned Sheep and it would have definitely gotten up again. However, the bolt that they were using wasn’t an ordinary bolt. It was smeared with the drug mixed from Black Pool Grass and Zoysia Grass. It simply became the nemesis of Horned Sheeps.

The drug swiftly went along with the blood vessels and reached the heart of the Horned Sheep. Soon, the wailing sound of the Horned Sheep was getting softer and softer.

“So fast!” Du Ze was surprised. He never thought that the drug that Nie Li mixed would have such a strong effect. After a moment, the robust sheep completely lost its resistance.

Lu Piao was also surprised. He fully understood the strength of these sheep, which was the strength of two Bronze rank Fighters combined. It usually required a long time to defeat one, but this Horned Sheep was defeated with just a small bolt.

“That was too thrilling!”

Whenever Lu Piao thought of the scene from earlier, it would bring back the fear that was lingering within him.

“If you hadn’t run, that Horned Sheep wouldn’t have been a threat to you!” Nie Li faintly laughed.

“Okay,” muttered Lu Piao, with his face turning red. He didn’t act according to the plan, and immediately panicked when he saw the Horned Sheep charging in his direction.

Seeing the fallen Horned Sheep, Lu Piao felt as if he was still living in a dream. Nie Li’s look and action from earlier till now was deeply engraved within his mind, leaving him with deep admiration. Ever since he was young, this was the first time Lu Piao had truly admired someone. Nie Li’s shooting skill was simply at the master level. Even if an ordinary person were to train for ten years, he still wouldn’t able to reach Nie Li’s level.

“Hurry up and clean up. We do not want anything other than the horns, the fur on the neck, the demon crystal, and the demon spirit!” Nie Li quickly ordered. A Horned Sheep’s demon crystal and demon spirit are located in the brain area. Demon crystals are thumb-sized crystals and most demon beasts had a demon crystal. As for the demon spirit, only one or two would appear within tens of thousands of Horned Sheep. The shape of the demon spirit is like a candle’s flame.

A Horned Sheep with a demon spirit would generally be stronger than the other Horned Sheeps.

Horned Sheeps are relatively low level, only 1-star Bronze rank demon beasts. The materials from them are relatively cheap. A pair of horns could be sold for five demon spirit coins, and the fur on it’s neck could be sold for three demon spirit coins. As for the demon crystal, it can be sold for five demon spirit coins.

Counting it this way, even if there is no demon spirit in it, it can still fetch a price of thirteen demon spirit coins.

They only took, at most, five minutes to kill the Horned Sheep. If it only takes this long, wouldn’t the three of them get thousands of demon spirit coins in one day?

Du Ze couldn’t help feeling excited. His family is very poor and their income would only be two to three thousand demon spirit coins annually. In order to let him enter the Holy Orchid Institute, Du Ze’s family had to borrow a lot of money from relatives and friends. Du Ze is the hope of their family! If he hunts horned sheep together with Nie Li, he would be able to pay for his own school fees in the future!

Nie Li smiled and said, “We have to be a little bit faster. There will be no rest tonight!”

“Okay!” Du Ze excitedly replied. Although they have yet to enter 1-star Bronze rank, their bodies are extremely strong. Staying up all night is nothing.

Lu Piao couldn’t help but wail as these two guys are simply misers. They would forsake rest for the sake of money! Although he’s sad, he doesn’t have much of a choice. Who asked him to get on this pirate ship?

The three of them worked closely together and continuously hunted Horned sheep. After killing dozens of them, Lu Piao would transport the materials out to have it sold.

In one night’s time, Nie Li’s group of three hunted a total of about one hundred and twenty horned sheep, which was sold for about one thousand, two hundred demon spirit coins. Splitting it equally, they each received about four hundred demon spirit coins.

This amount of money is simply amazing for someone that has yet to enter 1-star Bronze rank. Even for a Bronze rank Fighter, getting twenty to thirty demon spirit coins a day is already considered a lot.

Seven consecutive days was spent attending lessons during the day, while at night the three of them would come to the training grounds to kill Horned Sheep. Their money has now reached to more than ten thousand demon spirit coins, which can be considered a huge amount of wealth for them.

The students in the Holy Orchid Institute were all wondering why the amount of Horned Sheep in the training grounds suddenly dropped. In the past, they would just casually walk around and easily find Horned Sheep in groups. However, now one has to look around for a long time in order to find one. Could it be that there are beasts like tigers coming in and hunting these Horned Sheeps? The Holy Orchid Institute even specially dispatched instructors to investigate the cause, but found nothing.

On the eighth consecutive evening, Nie Li’s group of three was in the dark hunting Horned Sheep. The sky was dark and it was already midnight.

Lu Piao yawned and said, “Nie Li, I can’t take it anymore. I’m taking a short nap on top of the tree.”

Seven consecutive days of nonstop Horned Sheep hunting caused him to be so tired that he couldn’t continue anymore.

Not only Lu Piao, even Du Ze couldn’t take it anymore.

“Nie Li, I also have to sleep first,” Du Ze said. His eyelids have been fighting to stay awake for a whole seven days. Even a man of steel wouldn’t be able to endure it.

“You guys sleep first. We’ll pause the hunting tomorrow night. I have other plans,” Nie Li said. He had already accumulated more than sixteen thousand demon spirit coins. This is their first bucket of gold. With that, they can do a lot of stuff. It was no longer necessary to hunt Horned Sheep.

Lu Piao and Du Ze climbed up a towering tree, lied down on a branch and fell asleep immediately. Both of their childish faces were full of exhaustion. Although they both belonged to the premature-type, in the end they’re still just two teenagers.

Nie Li sped through the woods. A round moon hung in the sky. The sounds of various insects would be heard from time to time, causing the surrounding area to be increasingly quiet.

There’s no large sized demon beast around, so it’s extremely safe.

Suddenly, Nie Li heard an abnormal sound from the distant jungle. There seems to be someone else here.

“Who is still in the training grounds at this time?”

Nie Lie’s brows frowned and ran towards that direction. He hid in the woods while looking at the field that’s covered in moonlight. Using the moonlight to see, he saw a slender and slim figure standing in the middle of the moonlight. She had shoulder length hair, was wearing a leather jacket, and was exuding a faint blue light.

This is the light of soul force! Although it hadn’t step into Bronze rank, it should be entering Bronze rank soon.

Using the light from the soul force, Nie Lie’s eyes landed on her face. Her eyes were shut, her long eyelashes slightly trembled, and slender eyebrows. She had flawless, white skin glowing a healthy pink, and rich, delicate lips. She and Ye Ziyun possessed two different kinds of beauty. Ye Ziyun possessed a silent elegance, like a beautiful violet flower. While she was charming, with a  seductive and glamorous look, like a rose with thorns.

“Xiao Ning\'er, never would have thought it was her,” said Nie Li, slightly surprised for a moment. Xiao Ning\'er was more hard working than he imagined. She was still training her soul force at this time of night. He estimates that she’ll soon enter into Bronze rank.

Thinking of his previous life, when Xiao Ning\'er entered 1-star Bronze rank, she fell sick for more than two years and her cultivation regressed a lot. Although she had to re-trained herself from scratch, it’s said that since then she had been pain ridden. Although she had been ill, in the eyes of others, she had been like a dazzling star. She was a strong woman!

Thinking about how Xiao Ning\'er was training here in the middle of the night, Nie Li suddenly understood a lot. Although Xiao Ning\'er is very hard working, she is treating her life as joke.

After thinking awhile, Nie Li walked towards Xiao Ning\'er.

“Who!?” Xiao Ning\'er suddenly opens her eyes, and frailly shouted, while retrieving a short dagger. She warily looked at Nie Li. Her facial expression was chilling cold. Through the moonlight, those deeply alert eyes had an indescribable charm in them.

Although she was only thirteen years old, the current her can definitely be considered a beautiful teen. The leather jacket’s front chest area was slightly bulging. At this age, she can definitely be proud of it.

“I’m Nie Li!” Nie Li said. Although he has never talked with Xiao Ning\'er, they can still be considered classmates and were somewhat familiar with each other.

Xiao Ning\'er put down her short dagger, but still kept her guard up as she looked at Nie Li and said, “What are you doing here?”

Nie Li faintly smiled, “What are you doing here?”

“I’m here to train my soul force,” Xiao Ning\'er said, looking at Nie Li through the moonlight. Nie Li’s eyebrows were sharp. He had a bit of handsomeness, not like some people who looked terrifying from the first look.

Nie Li shrugged his shoulders and said, “I hang out around here.”

“You’re lying. Don’t think I don’t know. During these last few days, you guys have been the ones killing those Horned Sheep,” Xiao Ning\'er said. She had already seen Nie Li’s group of three, but she didn’t take any initiative to greet them. What Xiao Ning\'er was curious about was something that Nie Lie’s group smeared onto the bolts that was able to take down a Horned Sheep with one bolt, but she wouldn’t take the initiative to ask other people’s secrets.

“So you knew since long ago,” Nie Li said, looking at Xiao Ning\'er. When she pouts her mouth, her rich delicate lips had an indescribable charm to them. But he already had Ye Ziyun in his heart, so his feelings for Xiao Ning\'er’s beauty is simply appreciation. He appreciates her beauty and how hard-working she is. With Xiao Ning\'er’s appearance alone, she can stand at a very high position, yet she still relied on her own strength to change other people’s view towards her. It’s a pity that she’s using the wrong method.

INSERT INTO `chapter`(`book_id`,`name`,`data`,`number_of_read`,`upload_date`) VALUES(8,'chapter 7','“I’m going to continue practicing!” Xiao Ning\'er coldly stated as she stared at Nie Li with her bright, clear eyes.

Xiao Ning\'er didn’t like being disrupted by others. She had an expression that ‘pushed people thousands of miles away’ on her face, and because she rarely associated with the students in class, especially the boys, the friendless her seemed somewhat eccentric.

“I will leave, immediately!” Nie Li said as he faintly smiled. He checked her out from top to bottom.

Xiao Ning\'er’s brows wrinkled.

Isn’t the way Nie Li is looking at me a bit too rude? she thought. She couldn’t help feeling somewhat angry. There were lots of boys chasing after her in the Holy Orchid Institute, but Xiao Ning\'er had always ignored them. She only wants to focus on her training. Therefore, Nie Li’s actions right now was no different from the other boys in the institute. It was simply hateful!

“Are you still not leaving?” Xiao Ning\'er wasn’t happy by her tone. Nie Li had been disrupting her for quite some time now.

Nie Li’s gaze landed on Xiao Ning\'er’s legs. She wasn’t wearing any shoes, and he could see a pair of creamy slender legs illuminated by the moonlight, which were slightly red.

He said, “When night falls, don’t both of your legs feel as if they’re being burned by fire?”

After hearing what Nie Li just said, Xiao Ning\'er was slightly stunned and soon answered, “How did you know?”

Due to the burning heat, when training at night, Xiao Ning\'er usually wouldn’t wear shoes.

“Of course I know,” Nie Li smiled, “Not only this, I know even more. Not only do both of your legs feel as if they were being burned by fire, your body would be extremely cold. Every night at midnight it would feel as if it was hailing on your body. It would be terribly painful. Even training your soul force wouldn’t be possible, would it?”

Xiao Ning\'er was shocked by Nie Li’s words. She had been enduring the pain alone and did not tell anyone about this, not even her family members. How did Nie Li know about it?

Seeing the expression on Xiao Ning\'er’s face, Nie Li knew that he had guessed correctly. So Xiao Ning\'er’s previous life’s illness was the Arctic Disease. By training at night, it would often lead to chilled air entering the body, blocking the veins. The Arctic Disease would, in light cases, cause the person to get seriously ill, and in serious cases, it would cause the body to explode. So Xiao Ning\'er from his previous life was already very lucky to be bedridden for only two years.

“In addition to these symptoms, your body should be bruised in certain areas. Those bruises should be extremely painful and not only do they not dissipate, they should also be spreading around the body, ” Nie Li said confidently, “You haven’t stepped into 1-star Bronze rank yet, but once you do, in the best case scenario, you will get seriously ill and your cultivation will be greatly reduced. In the worst case scenario, you will die.”

After hearing Nie Li’s words, Xiao Ning\'er was momentarily dazed. Both of her fists were clenched tightly, and her eyes reddened. How could this be? Even though she’s very strong, after hearing the news, she couldn’t endure the blow.Nie Li could tell what her illness was with one glance. What he said shouldn’t be wrong.

Ever since she was young, her family had been wanting for her to marry into the Sacred Family, by marrying Shen Fei. As she grew up, Xiao Ning\'er gradually learned what kind of person Shen Fei was. Because she didn’t want to get married to that playboy, she started practicing very hard with hopes of getting rid of this cruel fate. Unfortunately, the heavens didn’t seem to want to let her do so, since she who would soon reach 1-star Bronze rank, suddenly got to hear such news.

Seeing the usually strong Xiao Ning\'er in this state, Nie Li couldn’t help pitying her.

“Nie Li, since you know what kind of illness I have, you should know how to treat it, right?” asked Xiao Ning\'er. Frightened by what Nie Li said, she unknowingly dropped her strong guard that she had up against him and pleaded, “Can you help me?”

She was, after all, only a thirteen year old girl.

Xiao Ning\'er had a strong personality and rarely asked others for help. Nie Li, after listening to her pleas, suddenly felt his heart soften. He was silent, only for a moment, before he said, “This illness can be treated. You can look it up in the Holy Orchid Institute’s library. The illness is called: Arctic Disease.”

“Really?” replied Xiao Ning\'er. Her hopes were raised, “How can it be treated?”

“The Daoyin technique must be used to massage the affected areas, to dissipate the bruise. Medicine made from combining Golden Striped Grass with Imperial Sky Grass must be consumed daily, with your situation, for roughly a month or so. In the best case scenario, ten days could be enough for you to be fully recovered from the illness,” Nie Li said. This was indeed the method to treat Arctic Disease.

“Daoyin technique?” repeated Xiao Ning\'er. She knitted her brows. She’s a member of a Noble family, but she had never heard of any Daoyin technique before.

“In addition to these treatment methods, you must also make sure to not train your soul force at night in the future,” Nie Li said as he stretched his hand out towards Xiao Ning\'er. He followed up with, “Take out your cultivation technique, and let me have a look at it.”

Xiao Ning looked up at Nie Li. If a stranger were to ask her to take out her cultivation technique, she’d feel that they’re simply trying to swindle her. But she, after seeing Nie Li’s expression, couldn’t help feeling a sense of trust towards him in her heart. Nie Li had told her so much already, so she had decided to place her complete trust in him. She retrieved her cultivation technique from her interspatial ring and handed it to him. It was a piece of slightly aged parchment paper, with a bunch of densely packed words written on it.

As Nie Li received the parchment paper from Xiao Ning\'er, he accidentally touched the back of her jade white, creamy hands, but Nie Li didn’t mind. Instead, he was carefully reading the paper.

After her hands were touched by Nie Li, Xiao Ning\'er quickly withdrew her hands and felt her heart flutter. Her mood was in a mess. She thought, what if Nie Li was trying to blackmail her? And what if he had impure thoughts about her?

When she raised her head, however, she saw that Nie Li hadn’t even noticed her reaction when their hands touched, and felt relieved. Nie Li’s expression, when he looked at the parchment paper, was especially serious. This caused Xiao Ning\'er to be a little absent-minded. She reacted only a moment later. She lowered her head and began to think about something.

“A huge and powerful noble family’s direct bloodline actually practices this kind of low-grade cultivation technique. It’s no wonder Glory City was destroyed…” Nie Li quietly murmured.

“What did you just say?” Xiao Ning\'er widened her eyes and looked at Nie Li. She only heard some of the words Nie Li murmured, but she couldn’t hear it clearly.

“Nothing,” Nie Li faintly laughed, “This cultivation technique is too poor. it’ll damage the meridian as one practices it. The reason behind your Arctic Disease can be largely attributed to this cultivation technique. Change this part from ‘psychic mind’ to ‘heavenly psychic’ and change this to ‘soul and spirit merge’…” Nie Li continued to talk, altering the soul force cultivation technique beyond recognition.

Xiao Ning\'er, while listening to Nie Li as he altered her soul force cultivation technique, felt somewhat unconvinced. This cultivation technique was passed down by her ancestors. It was ranked six in the family’s collection of cultivation techniques. How could it be altered on a whim by Nie Li? Regardless, Xiao Ning\'er still listened to Nie Li’s words. She was, after all, a practitioner of this cultivation technique, so she had some experience on some matters regarding it. Gradually, Xiao Ning\'er realised that the modifications Nie Li did to it were reasonable. In fact, the modifications made it much better than the original.

Xiao Ning\'er’s eyes widened and an incredible look was in them as she stared at Nie Li.

“Nie Li, can you repeat it again? I need to remember what you just said!” Xiao Ning\'er said quickly.

“Okay,” Nie Li slowed his speech, repeating the modification for the cultivation technique. After training her soul force, Xiao Ning\'er got the ability to memorize anything without forgetting it. Even though she could only comprehend some of the modifications, she still managed to memorize what Nie Li said. The more she looked at it, the more she realised how much more powerful the cultivation technique that was modified by Nie Li was.

Xiao Ning\'er’s gaze towards Nie Li initially had a hint of confusion in it, but it was soon turned into one filled with admiration.

How much knowledge regarding soul force must one have in order to change this high-ranked soul force cultivation technique to such an extent? Even Black Gold rank Demon Spiritualists wouldn’t necessarily be able to do such a thing. Could Nie Li’s understanding of cultivation have long surpassed a Black Gold rank Demon Spiritualist’s, even reaching towards the Legend rank Demon Spiritualist’s realm?

Treating it as a treasure, Xiao Ning\'er deeply memorized all the modifications that Nie Li did to her cultivation technique in her heart. She couldn’t tell what her feelings towards Nie Li were: awe, worship?

Nie Li’s age was the same as hers, but Xiao Ning\'er realised that there was a wide gap between them. It was ridiculous that she used to think that Nie Li was the ‘tail of the class’. She realised just how ignorant Teacher Shen Xiu and the other students were as they ridiculed Nie Li. She was completely convinced that what Nie Li previously said in class about becoming a powerful Legend rank Demon Spiritualist was all true!

Ever since she was young, no matter if it’s talent or intelligence, Xiao Ning\'er had far surpassed her peers. This was the first time she looked up to someone her own age.

Nie Li had said before that he would marry the most beautiful girl in Glory City. When she thought of that, Xiao Ning\'er’s thoughts got messy. She speechlessly lowered her head. All of a sudden, a figure appeared in her mind. It was Ye Ziyun. Although Xiao Ning\'er was confident in her looks, she had to admit that she might not necessarily be able to compete with Ye Ziyun.

“What are you thinking about?” Nie Li asked, looking towards Xiao Ning\'er. He was puzzled since her expression was a bit strange.

“No, Nothing….” Xiao Ning\'er quickly shook her head, expelling all the thoughts she had in her head and asked, “Nie Li, do you know the Daoyin technique?”

“Of course I do,” Nie Li nodded his head and continued, “But the Daoyin technique requires direct contact with the bruised area. It wouldn’t seem appropriate if I were to be the one doing it.”

Xiao Ning\'er looked up at Nie Li’s chiseled cheeks. He had sharp eyebrows, and deep lights flashed in his black pupils. He had a bit of a handsomeness aura around him, which was slowly merging with the image she had in her heart.

She lowered her head and said, “I don’t mind. Weren’t you just treating me? I don’t want to turn into a useless person.”

That last sentence Xiao Ning\'er said was to comfort herself.

In front of Nie Li, Xiao Ning\'er dropped the cold guard she had up against him.

“Uh……” Nie Li went silent for a moment.

‘Even if she’s a girl and doesn’t mind, if I were to refuse I’ll be too petty.’

His heart already had Ye Ziyun. He only had a small impression towards Xiao Ning\'er. He did not think much about it and said, “Okay then, I’ll help you with the Daoyin technique to treat your illness once every three days. Do what I just told you when you go back. Eat those herbs and you will be fine.”

“En,” replied Xiao Ning\'er, nodding in silence.

“Where’s your bruised area?” Nie Li asked.

Xiao Ning\'er’s cold cheeks slightly blushed and pointed to the back of her foot.

“There’s one here.”

Nie Li lowered his head to look at it. He saw a patch of deep purple on the top of one of Xiao Ning\'er’s silky white feet. The bruise was already this serious.

“So serious,” said Nie Li. He frowned and continued. “Luckily it’s only on the foot, otherwise it would be a little troublesome elsewhere. It’s a lot more convenient, since it’s at the top of the foot. I will be done soon.”

Nie Li crouched down, and sat on the grass patch.

“En,” said Xiao Ning\'er, nodding her head. She didn’t say that that’s the only bruised area. When she placed her foot on Nie Li’s legs, a light flashed across her eyes. She seemed to be thinking of something.

INSERT INTO `chapter`(`book_id`,`name`,`data`,`number_of_read`,`upload_date`) VALUES(8,'chapter 8','Gripping onto Xiao Ning\'er\'s creamy jade white foot made Nie Li’s heart swing. Nie Li could clearly see that Xiao Ning\'er\'s smooth tight calves were simply perfect.

"Don\'t misunderstand, I\'m only treating your illness. The girl I like is Ye Ziyun. It\'s a pleasure to meet you. I hope that we can be friends in the future," Nie Li explained as he looked at Xiao Ning\'er\'s charming face.

Hearing Nie Li\'s words, Xiao Ning\'er\'s shoulders slightly shook. She nodded her head and faintly muttered, ”En.”  

From young till now, aside from her father, Nie Li is the only male that has touched her skin directly. But, the one that Nie Li likes is Ye Ziyun. At thought the of her, Xiao Ning\'er\'s nose slightly turned sour.

(TLN: \'en\' is kind of a sound that indicate agreement, something like okay but they used \'en\' instead)

Nie Li gripped Xiao Ning\'er\'s foot, positioned his thumb at the bruised area and, gently, started his massage.

"Ah" Xiao Ning\'er couldn\'t help to let out a pained sound.

"The first time will hurt a little. Bear with me for awhile," said Nie Li. He suddenly thought of something and felt embarrassed. Holding a girl\'s leg and saying such words, sounded a little weird. Although Xiao Ning\'er is only thirteen years old, she grew up in a aristocrat family, and would, naturally, have some knowledge regarding these matters. After all, some of the girls her age are already married with kids.

Xiao Ning\'er lowered her head. Her cheeks flushed red, and couldn\'t help the weird feeling in her heart.

The blushing face of Xiao Ning\'er was especially charming. It made Nie Li\'s heart jumped. Xiao Ning\'er was indeed on par with Ye Ziyun\'s beauty in the previous life. Although she\'s only thirteen years old, she is already very charming. In the previous life Xiao Ning\'er and Ye Ziyun were both goddesses that the boys looked up to. Ye Ziyun was full of grace and elegance, while Xiao Ning\'er had a cold figure, made the both of them their dream lovers.

But after thinking about Ye Ziyun, Nie Li stop thinking and focused on treating Xiao Ning\'er.

Under Nie Li\'s gentle massage, Xiao Ning\'er felt intense pain at the beginning but the pain was soon replaced by the warmth of Nie Li\'s hand entering her foot. After a while, there was the feeling of hot ants drilling into her foot, making her itch, which was replaced with a blissful numbness. Xiao Ning\'er couldn\'t help letting out a little \'ah\', which made her endlessly bashful.

That bruise had been there for about six to seven months now. Over time, she would feel terrible pain from it. Xiao Ning\'er had been enduring the pain with her will power this whole time. However, no matter how much she persevered, the pain had been torturing her all this time. Xiao Ning\'er originally thought that treating this patch of bruise would be very uncomfortable and painful, but, to her surprise, Nie Li\'s massage was very gentle. She felt the pain that has been torturing her all this time was alleviated by a lot. She couldn\'t help as her eyes turned watery. No one knew how hard it was to bear the pain. Every night, she would secretly cry. After wiping those tears off, she would continue to practice. She never thought that after being massaged by Nie Li, the pain would be relieved by this much. Her heart was filled with gratitude.

Under the moonlight, Nie Li\'s face was clear. The serious expression that he had on his face set ripples off in Xiao Ning\'er\'s heart, making it hard for her to calm down.

"Done," said Nie Li finished the massage.

He faintly laughed and said, "For the next few day, there will still be traces of pain, but all you need to do is rest and you will be fine."

"En," said Xiao Ning\'er, nodding her head. Suddenly, her cheeks flushing red, she continued to say, "I still have another bruise, could you massage it, too?"

"Another bruise?"

Nie Li thought for a moment, ‘Right... there should have been another one. The bruise on her leg shouldn\'t have caused her to be bedridden for two years. There should be a more serious bruise!’

"Where is it?" he asked.

Xiao Ning\'er felt her heart struggling.

‘If it\'s only to let Nie Li massage my legs, it\'s still acceptable, but if it\'s that place......’ Xiao Ning\'er hesitated for a long time, her face shyly blushing red.

"If it\'s not convenient...." began Nie Li, seeing Xiao Ning\'er\'s expression. He immediately realised that the bruised area should be at an inconvenient location.

"Nie Li, the person you like is Ye Ziyun?"

"Yeah," Nie Li nodded his head and replied, recalling everything that happened in his previous life. The life and death situation that he and Ye Ziyun had gone through. His heart was suddenly filled with happiness just by thinking about it. With his rebirth, he will definitely protect Ye Ziyun.

At this moment, after listening to Nie Li\'s words, Xiao Ning\'er had a weird taste in her heart. Nie Li was the first boy to move her heart, but the one Nie Li likes isn\'t her. It was Ye Ziyun.

Xiao Ning\'er\'s eyes flashed with disappointment, thought for a moment and asked, "Then, does Ye Zu Yun like you?"

The current Ye Ziyun doesn\'t know anything about Nie Li. Not hating him would already consider very good. Nie Li shook his head, smiled and confidently said, "She will fall in love with me!"

Looking at Nie Li, Xiao Ning\'er laughed, ‘So Nie Li’s love is unrequited. I don\'t know where that confidence of his comes from. He actually thinks that the prideful Ye Ziyun would fall for him.’

Not that Xiao Ning\'er feels that Nie Li is unworthy of Ye Ziyun\'s love, but the neither of them has any understanding towards each other. The chances of them coming together is too slim. The current Ye Ziyun still doesn\'t have any understanding towards Nie Li, hence, she would definitely have no feelings for him. But if one day, if Ye Ziyun understood Nie Li\'s character, she might really fall for him.

Till now, no one seems to have realise Nie Li\'s talent. However, one day Nie Li will definitely shine. By then, she fears that even a prideful girl like Ye Ziyun will be subdued by Nie Li.

In the eyes of others, Nie Li is still an ignorant boy, but Xiao Ning\'er knows that Nie Li\'s ability is far beyond the imagination of other people. Nie Li will definitely become a Legend rank Demon Spiritist like Lord Ye Mo in the future or become an even  more powerful existance.

Xiao Ning\'er struggled for awhile in her heart. ‘If the illness doesn\'t get treated, I will get thrown further and further apart from the surrounding genius of my age.’

Since the one helping her with the treatment is Nie Li, it wasn\'t that hard to accept. Grinding her teeth, she began to undo the buttons on her shirt. Seeing Xiao Ning\'er\'s action, Nie Li couldn\'t help feeling embarrassed.

He rubbed his nose and said, "This doesn\'t look good. I\'m a decent person."

He watched as Xiao Ning\'er slowly removed her shirt. Her cold figure had an unspeakable charm to it.

Xiao Ning\'er stared at Nie Li as she thought, ‘Then is she a ** kind of girl?’

If it wasn’t for her treatment, she wouldn\'t even take the initiative to undo her shirt. As she  unbuttoned her shirt, her hands slightly trembled and her inner struggle could be seen.(TLN: ** is actually in the raw text btw)

Nie Li thought for awhile. ‘I know it is to save her, so I can\'t think too much about other stuff. I can\'t let Xiao Ning\'er\'s hope be crumbled by the disease.’

The surrounding atmosphere turned charming. The first button, then the second button. Xiao Ning\'er\'s fat-less smooth white skin was already visible, glowing under the moonlight.

After the fifth button was undone, Xiao Ning\'er\'s perfect curves were absolutely shattering. Her chest was tied with a bandage with a beautiful bulge pushing out. Although Nie Li was reborn, seeing this scene, he couldn\'t help to swallow down a mouthful of saliva. He thought back on his previous life. Although Xiao Ning\'er dressed extremely conservative, her figure can be described as extremely hot. With only a glance, she would drive many men crazy.

Soon, Xiao Ning\'er will grow up to be that charming and attractive women. Her cold and noble character would made her the object that many men wish to conquer.

Nie Li calmed his mind for a bit and his eyes fell on Xiao Ning\'er\'s ribs. On her lower rib sat an extremely shocking bruise. Although it is only the size of a thumb, the colour of the bruise was very deep. His heart was full of pity for Xiao Ning\'er.

‘How can such a delicate and pitiful young girl endure such intense pain?’ he asked himself.

Nie Li placed his hands on the bruised area and gently massage it. Xiao Ning\'er\'s skin was as cold as water. Her well-proportioned body had a creamy smooth texture, which he felt through his hand, making his heart swing. He tilted his head up to look at Xiao Ning\'er\'s face. She was burning red, almost as though she had just had a drink of alcohol, giving her a sense of unspeakable beauty. Looking from above, he could see Xiao Ning\'er\'s jade white shoulders, and realized a scent of female fragrance coming from her.

Silently, the both of them did not speak and the woods were quiet and serene.

Xiao Ning\'er could feel the warmth from Nie Li\'s palm. From young till now, this is the first time a guy was so intimately in contact with her body. Right now, her shirt was half removed, revealing a large patch of skin, making her bashful. Even though her heart is strong, in the dead silent night, her heart was very lonely. When was experiencing the unbearable pain caused by the bruise, she wanted to find someone to rely on. But in the family, no matter if it\'s her brothers or father, she felt deeply indifferent.Nie Li, at this moment, was the only one, she felt, that she could rely on.

The best she has was shown toNie Li. She glanced at Nie Li and realised that Nie Li, at this moment, was focused on massaging her bruised area. That serious attitude of his made her to feel gratitude, but at the same time she felt lost.

While Nie Li\'s thumb was massaging the bruised area, he would accidentally touched Xiao Ning\'er\'s jade white arms from time to time. That delicate touch would make anyone distracted, even if it\'s Nie Li. Nie Li\'s mind would return to the scenes of him and Ye Ziyun\'s one night of passion.

Ye Ziyun, at that time, had developed much better than the current Xiao Ning\'er, but the current Xiao Ning\'er is still young. Once she grows up, she shouldn\'t have that much difference compared to Ye Ziyun.

Ye Ziyun\'s charming and elegant look would appear in Nie Li\'s mind from time to time and he would remember that Ye Ziyun died to save him Therefore, after his rebirth, Nie Li definitely cannot let her down. Thinking of that, Nie Li\'s heart finally calmed down.

While Nie Li was carefully massaging the bruised area with his thumb, he would tapon several important acupuncture points. Because of Xiao Ning\'er\'s well-proportioned body, he would occasionally massage a sensitive spot and would feel the soft bulge, leaving Nie Li slightly embarrassed.

Xiao Ning\'er felt the surge of heat coming from Nie Li\'s hand as it moved around the rib area. From time to time she would even feel a blissful numbness. Nie Li\'s hand would occasionally touch the twin perks that no other man has touched before, making her blush wine red. The look she had when she\'s blushing was extremely attractive. That girl\'s charming and enchanting looks would make others unable to do anything but want to take her in their arms.

This was a really tough ordeal. After massaging for a long time, Nie Li let out a breath, smiled and said, "Done!"

Feeling Nie Li\'s hand move away, Xiao Ning\'er felt a sense of loss. She had to admit, Nie Li\'s massage technique was amazing. It helped her relieve the pain that tortured her for so long.

"Thank you," Xiao Ning\'er whispered as she started to button her shirt. Seeing the jade white skin, graceful curves slowly disappearing from his sight, Nie Li\'s ups and downs mood was calmed down.

With a stern face, he said, "Rest well for the next few days. This should help to alleviate the pain. I\'ll give you a massage every three days, a few times more and the roots of the illness will be removed. Before reaching Bronze rank, don\'t train your soul force at night. Absorbing too much moonlight essence, if you are unable to harmonize with it, would cause serious consequences!"

"En," Xiao Ning\'er nodded her head. She no longer dared to practice, anyhow. If it wasn\'t for Nie Li, she can imagine how terrible the situation would’ve been in the future. All of her efforts and hard work would’ve been in vain.

Seeing Xiao Ning\'er without any other issue, Nie Li stood up and said, "It’s time for me to leave."

"Oh."

She couldn\'t tell what her feelings were. Xiao Ning\'er nodded and went silent for a moment before saying, "Nie Li, you\'ve helped me. If there\'s anything you need my help with in the future, I will spare no effort to help you!"

Seeing Xiao Ning\'er\'s serious expression, Nie Li smiled. While nodding his head, he said "Okay, if I need your help in the future, I\'ll find you!"

Truth is, Nie Li helped Xiao Ning\'er out of pity towards her. He never thought of getting anything back in return.

Nie Li turned around and left, his shadow slowly disappeared into the forest.

Xiao Ning\'er stared at Nie Li’s leaving figure. She stood on the spot for a long time, feeling that the illness in her body has already alleviated by a lot. Her mood became cheerful again.

"Nie Li, what kind of person are you, actually?" Xiao Ning\'er muttered, watching Nie Li from the back. When she could no longer see him, she turned around and walk towards the exit of the training ground.

The moon was like water. As the moonlight shined, it would sprinkle a layer of veil over the night.
